I just got a C program up and running with SDL2 on Windows. I'll be working on building out a Linux + Mac install script next. 

Why? I want to get closer to the metal, even if it has more foot guns. It's a case of 'worse is better'.

I've also started learning Prolog. It's very different from anything else I've learned. In a way, it's similar to SQL and table based searching. I still got a long ways to go, but I think I'll stick around for a while.

Stay tuned for more updates.
