I've been playing with Haskell lately. Nothing too crazy, but I wanted to dig into a language that is strongly typed and functional. 

Coming from an iterative background it is a bit odd, but nothing very hard. I won't be digging into crazy abstractions, mainly trying to stay with the core language.

For today, I've been generating some simple C code. 

I started out with a test C program, then implemented that in a `Lib` module.

```
-- Lib.hs
module Lib
  ( testProgram
  ) where

import           Data.List

-- Example C program to compile.
-- Working from a bottom up approach.
testProgram :: String
testProgram =
  joinNl
    [ "#include <stdio.h>"
    , ""
    , "int main()"
    , "{"
    , joinNl (indent ["printf(\"Hello world\\n\");", "return 0;"])
    , "}"
    ]

-- Join all strings with new lines.
joinNl :: [String] -> String
joinNl text = intercalate "" (map nl text)

-- Adds a new line to a string.
nl :: String -> String
nl text = text ++ "\n"

-- Adds a tab to a string.
tab :: String -> String
tab text = "\t" ++ text

-- Indents a list of strings.
indent :: [String] -> [String]
indent = map tab

```

All this does is take lines of code, formats it, and spits it out. It will most certainly evolve over time. Starting simple is easiest though.

In a `Main.hs` file I call this, print out the contents and write it to a file. I'm going with a hexagonal architecture, where `Main.hs` controls IO.

```
module Main where

import           Data.List
import           Lib                (testProgram)
import           System.Environment
import           System.Process

main
    -- Read in args from CLI
 = do
  args <- getArgs -- IO [String]
  progName <- getProgName -- IO String
  putStrLn "The arguments are:"
  mapM_ putStrLn args
  putStrLn "The program name is:"
  putStrLn progName
    -- Now show the program
  putStrLn "-----------"
  putStrLn "- PROGRAM -"
  putStrLn "-----------"
  putStrLn testProgram
  -- Compile the program
  putStrLn "-----------"
  putStrLn "- COMPILE -"
  putStrLn "-----------"
  writeFile "../testc/test.c" testProgram

-- This will execute a system process.
-- TODO: wire this up to another compiler such as GCC or a JS one.
executeProcess :: IO String
executeProcess = readProcess "seq" ["1", "10"] ""
```

Lastly I'll show the generated C code:

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	printf("Hello world\n");
	return 0;

}
```

With that done, next I'll pick a slightly more complex C program and refactor things to generate it. I would also like to do something with JavaScript, C sharp or Rust. Stay tuned.
