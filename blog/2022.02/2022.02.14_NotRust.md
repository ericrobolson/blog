That was a fun little diversion. I'm not building a interpreter in Rust at this point. There's too much baggage and verbosity. Instead I'll shelve the idea of an interpreter.

What will I work on? I have two ideas.

1) Would be a game of some form. Either a roguelike or a fighting game. I could either use Unity, Monogame or Godot. Leaning towards Monogame or Unity as they are cross platform. 
2) Learn Prolog/Scheme/C. I'm probably not gonna learn C at this time, or if I do it will be to use as a target language. I do have several books on Scheme I need to grind through, but I'm most excited about learning Prolog as I have a book in the mail. 

I'll revisit this tomorrow or later this week.
