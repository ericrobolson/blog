Everything is up for my `BuilderGenerator` spritesheet project. I could certainly see it evolving over time, but for now it's good enough to utilize.

Granted, it only does isometric sprites, but that is not a problem for me. There are a few game jams I would like to participate in that I think will benefit from this.

On a different note, I'll try to post every day but I won't make promises to do so. Sometimes life gets in the way.
