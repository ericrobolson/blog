## 0700

I seem to continually bounce between projects. From C to Rust to Scheme to Elixir to Prolog, I'm all over the place. 

We'll see where I end up. 

I recently got a Elektron Digitakt sampler and have been getting back into music production. I'm not nearly as good as I used to be, but that's totally fine. Being humbled isn't too bad.

Perhaps I will go back to Rust and work my way through some tutorials or use Bevy. My main concern is making a tiny core that runs the game so I could theoretically wire up a server using Elixir if needed. 

C is a nice diversion though, as it helps solidify concepts Rust abstracts away.

Here's a simple C program + bash script to install SDL2 and link it on Windows.

[Click here to view the repo.](https://github.com/ericrobolson/DemoC/)

I've been posting my C programs to my DemoC repository as that way I can reference it in the future.


To begin, I wrote up a `installs.sh` script to download SDL2 for windows and link it. 

```
#
# Helper funcs
#

# Make directories
function dir (){
	[[ ! -d ${1} ]] && mkdir ${1}
}


#
# Directories
# 
CURRENT_DIR=$PWD
BIN=bin
BUILD=.build
INCLUDE=.include
INSTALLS=.installs
LIB=.lib

rm -rd $BUILD
rm -rd $INSTALLS
rm -rd $LIB
rm -rd $INCLUDE
rm -rd $BIN

dir $BUILD
dir $INSTALLS
dir $LIB
dir $INCLUDE
dir $BIN

#
# OS specific stuff
#
OS=undefined
if [[ "${OSTYPE}" == "cygwin" ]]; then
	OS=windows
else
	echo "Unknown OS '${OSTYPE}'"
	exit 1
fi


function installSdl(){
	cd $CURRENT_DIR

	if [[ "$OS" == "windows" ]]; then
		# Download + extract
		FILE=SDL2-devel.tar.gz
		curl https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-devel-2.0.20-mingw.tar.gz --output SDL2-devel.tar.gz
		tar -xf $FILE -C $BUILD
		mv -T $BUILD/SDL2-* $BUILD/SDL2

		# Copy files to where they need to go
		SDL2=$BUILD/SDL2
		src=$SDL2/x86_64-w64-mingw32

		

		# Headers
		dir $INCLUDE/SDL2
		cp -r $src/include/SDL2/ $INCLUDE/

		# Library
		cp -r $src/lib/. $LIB

		# binary
		cp $src/bin/SDL2.dll $BIN

		# Readme - do this on all installs
		cp $SDL2/README-SDL.txt $BIN
	else 
		echo "TODO: sdl2 on $OS"
		exit 1
	fi
}


installSdl
```

Next I wrote a `Makefile` to actually compile my program. Nothing complex here.

```

include = -I.include
lib = -L.lib

build:
	gcc $(include) $(lib) src/main.c -Wall -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -o bin/main

run: build
	echo "TODO"
```

Finally I'll show off the program.

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <SDL2/SDL.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	if (SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING) != 0)
	{
		printf("Error initializing SDL: %s\n", SDL_GetError());
		return 1;
	}

	SDL_Window *window = SDL_CreateWindow("SDL2 Window",
										  SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED,
										  SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED,
										  680, 480,
										  0);
	if (!window)
	{
		printf("Error initializing SDL window: %s\n", SDL_GetError());
		return 1;
	}

	SDL_Surface *window_surface = SDL_GetWindowSurface(window);

	if (!window_surface)
	{
		printf("Failed to get window surface: %s\n", SDL_GetError());
		return 1;
	}

	printf("Success.\n");
	SDL_Quit();
	return 0;
}
```
