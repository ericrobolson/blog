Hello there, it's been a while. This past month I've been relaxing, taking some time off and visiting Florida and getting back into the swing of life. A break is extremely necessary and something I plan on doing more and more of. I was able to get some exploratory coding done, take some nice photos and check out some places I've never been to.

For my current projects, I don't really have much going on right now. I'm muddling around with Haskell and will be learning Prolog shortly. There's one or two books on Scheme I need to dig into and a book on Elixir I need to wrap up. Not to mention C. 

Oh well, such is life. It's all about narrowing down what you want to do. Expect to see more posts now that I'm back.
