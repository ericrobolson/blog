I think these next few posts will be smaller and bite sized. I've been getting more and more into music creation as well as drawing. Trying to get into some hobbies that aren't exclusively coding.

Perhaps I'll throw that up here in the future.

One thing I've added is a list of includes and a simple function that outputs a C function.

With that said, here's the modified `Lib.rs` that includes the includes and function creator.

```
-- Lib.rs
module Lib
  ( testPrograms
  ) where

import           Data.List

-- Test programs
testPrograms :: [String]
testPrograms = [testProgram, testProgram2]

-- Example C program to compile.
-- Working from a bottom up approach.
testProgram :: String
testProgram =
  joinNl
    [ includes
    , ""
    , "int main()"
    , "{"
    , joinNl (indent ["printf(\"Hello world\\n\");", "return 0;"])
    , "}"
    ]

-- Example C program to compile.
-- Working from a bottom up approach.
testProgram2 :: String
testProgram2 = joinNl [includes, "", func Int "main" [] []]

-- A list of standard includes.
includes :: String
includes =
  joinNl ["#include <stdio.h>", "#include <stdbool.h>", "#include <stdint.h>"]

data Type =
  Int

instance Show Type where
  show Int = "int"

data Args =
  Args
  deriving (Show)

newtype Statement =
  Statement String
  deriving (Show)
```

I've also modified the `Main.hs` program to print a list of programs and write them to disk. I still need to add in the ability to nest files and output proper names.

```
-- Main.hs
module Main where

import           Data.List
import           Lib                (testPrograms)
import           System.Environment
import           System.Process

main = do
  mapM writeProgram testPrograms

-- Prints a program and writes it out.
writeProgram :: String -> IO ()
writeProgram program = do
  putStrLn "------------"
  putStrLn "------------"
  putStrLn "------------"
  putStrLn program
  -- TODO: add in file names + folder to put it in.
  -- TODO: output a .gitignore to exclude binaries.
  writeFile "../testc/testy.c" program

-- This will execute a system process.
-- TODO: wire this up to another compiler such as GCC or a JS one.
executeProcess :: IO String
executeProcess = readProcess "seq" ["1", "10"] ""
```

I don't know where I'll end up with this, but it's a fun little diversion. Perhaps I'll make a VM or a native Lisp compiler. Rust would be a fun target, as would JavaScript.


At some point I need to switch this to a static site to minimize bandwidth. Perhaps that's a good first project.
