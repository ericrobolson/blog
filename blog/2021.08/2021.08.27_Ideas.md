I'm planning on writing a turn based multiplayer game. I've been playing mostly Rivals of Aether and Dota Underlords, and have been thinking of 40k, Infinity and Warmachine.

Idea:
* Economy based, like Underlords
* Point based (rather than drafting) like 40k/Infinity
* More fine grained positioning like in 40k. E.g. no grid.
* More heavily starting position based. Use a larger starting area
* More terrain variety
* Autobattler where after position is locked in, it's automatically played. 30s tops

Architecture:
* Erlang-based backend
* * Elixir for the 'glue' + db
* * Perhaps Rust as a NIF for game usage? The input is pulled from an ETS/redis, ran through Rust, then put back?
* RabbitMQ for messaging
* GraphQL for networking
* Ratelimiting?
* Sockets/Channels
* Native clients that render some form of DSL to interact with the backend
* * Stores results in a local db?
* * That enables offline usage?
