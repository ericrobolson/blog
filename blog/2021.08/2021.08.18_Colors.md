Early day today. I'll be picking the color scheme for this blog. A resource I've utilized in the past is the [Color Scheme Bible](https://www.amazon.com/Color-Scheme-Bible-Inspirational-2012-08-30/dp/B0163DTJKO). The only downside is that there are no RGB values on the schemes, so I'll be utilizing either [RGB Color Detector](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TheProgrammer.RGBColorDetector&hl=en_US&gl=US) or [Color Grab](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loomatix.colorgrab&hl=en_US&gl=US). 

After using them for a bit, RGB Color Detector has a worse UX with ads, but a far more useful workflow. Color Grab doesn't take a picture and let you pick from there by default, whereas RGB Color Detector does. My vote goes to RGB Color Detector.

I'll also be adding a CSS preprocessor.

Color scheme is mostly done. I'm now going through and tweaking CSS to get it all proper.

Things to do:

* Side nav
* Footer
* Top nav?
* CSS for quotes
* CSS for code blocks/quotes (need to make it scroll on x-axis)
* Links to other .md files
* Arbitrary nesting of HTML in lists
* Index.html
* Constants
* Data driven


Here's WIP shot:

After reviewing the scheme for a while, I think I will pivot the colors. Something like Youtube, with white, black, grey, blue and red. It's simpler, easier on the eyes, and more timeless than what I currently have.

Here's a WIP of the new color scheme:

I think for my purposes the color scheme is finalized. This is one that I could utilize in many different areas to ensure a consistent UX, but perhaps that is getting ahead of myself.

I've started building out the generation of keywords, summary, and metadata sections. I've also decided to make a title section required. 

These additions will be checked and if they are not present, compilation will stop. This should ensure that I keep all entries in a consistent format. 

Perhaps I'll do a deep dive on how this is all structured after I wrap it up. 

One thing I would like to do is add a random image generator that takes in the title + key words and spits out a thumbnail of a fractal. This would be my final touch on the project before I change it to a LTS mode and stop active feature development. 


This [YCombinator article on SEO](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/44-the-basics-of-seo) is what I'm going off of. Perhaps it is outdated, but it's a nice target to hit.
