Hello there! It's been a while.

Here's what I've been up to:
* Bouldering again
* Running
* Lifting 2-3 times a week
* Trivia
* Building a TCP client/server in Rust
* Making music with the Digitakt

While each of these could take up an entire post, I'll be talking about the client/server in Rust. 

This has gone through many different iterations, but this is the simplest that works.

You can check out the code on [DemoRust](https://github.com/ericrobolson/DemoRust).
