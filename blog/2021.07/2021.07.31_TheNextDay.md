I would like to timestamp these entries. It will be done in 24h time.


I've wired up an Emacs config file. This setup runs across Mac silicone + Windows Linux subsystem. Being able to have the same env across machines seems like it would be beneficial, so it's what I shall attempt to do. The Emacs Lisp seems like it will allow many useful things to be done once I grok it. 
Remains to be seen.

I can't say what the next step is. I'm going through [a set of Emac tutorials](https://y.tsutsumi.io/2014/01/22/emacs-from-scratch-part-1-extending-emacs-basics/) to get familiar with this IDE. Change is good, and forces evolution. Sometimes it's arbitrarily done but the intent is to get used to things that 
aren't constant. Being able to quickly pivot seems valuable. I'll go through the next tutorial then work on getting [Slime](https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/) set up. From there I may begin hacking together the first prototypes for a web game or website. CICD still needs to be researched and implemented.
