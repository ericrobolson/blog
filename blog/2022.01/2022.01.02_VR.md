The past week or so I've been grinding Pistol Whip. It's in the top two for VR games.

Now that Watcher in the Deep is good enough, I'll switch to another project. I do want to make a VR game at some point in my life, and rhythm arcade based games seem to be the ticket.

Another genre I would like to experiment with is arcade beat 'em ups, such as Streets of Rage. The games in this genre aren't complex, but good fun. Perhaps something that is a cross between Pistol Whip and this genre?
