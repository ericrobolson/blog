One thing I really want to do is embrace procedural generation. As a solo dev, I can't take time to craft everything by hand. If I can leverage a program to generate gameplay, I will do so.

To that end, I'm building out the following process:
* Take in some seed files
* Generate levels from those files
* Export as JSON
* Serve with Elixir to enable hot reloading
* Import into Unity/Godot
* Build game from the level specifications

I've already done the first 4 steps, just need to figure out the rest. Not sure where this will end up, but I think a data driven approach is the proper way forward.
