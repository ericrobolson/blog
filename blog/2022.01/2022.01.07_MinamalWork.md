Not sure how much I'll be able to get done today. I got the covid booster shot yesterday, did not sleep well, and woke up with a massive headache.

I started out by reading the Unity docs on [Monobehaviours](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Update.html). Why? Well, I plan to write a core library that contains all my specific game logic and then Unity will interface with that. 

The reason for doing so is that I can then start work on a VR and non-VR implementation for games. I'll be away from my headset for a few weeks, so being able to dev without VR will be necessary.
