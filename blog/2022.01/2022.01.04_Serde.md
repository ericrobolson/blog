This morning I spent a bit of time writing a converter for Rust classes to C# classes. It ain't pretty, and it certainly doesn't work well, but it is a start.

I fully expect I'll need to rework it, but the intent is that I can then ensure that my data stays in the same format, regardless of where it comes from.

It will be something that I evolve over time, potentially releasing later on.

My next project will be going through a few VR tutorials to get a handle for how Unity works. From there I will start hacking on a game.
