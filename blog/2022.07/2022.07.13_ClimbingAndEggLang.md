Lately I've been getting back into climbing. I've been hitting up the bouldering gym consistently and will be taking some top rope lessons before hitting up WA for some routes. It's been great.

Another project I've been working on is [EggLang](https://github.com/ericrobolson/EggLang). While far from complete, the goal is a statically typed language like Haxe. Right now I have it so it can parse tokens and do basic tree generation. 

Not entirely sure where I'll take the front end, so I've been working on the back end. I'm taking an approach similiar to PureScript in that operations are specified in JSON for each target language to allow easy extension. The benefit of that is the ability to bootstrap the backend and consume the same rules, so I should get the same output.

For an overarching project roadmap I would like to do the following:
* Backend: Target C
* Backend: Target JavaScript
* Backend: Target C#
* Frontend: Implement macros
* Frontend: Implement static typing

I still need to decide on whether to do a Lisp, a C type language or a stack based language, but I can defer that until I wrap up the basic backends.
