Made some more progress with Lisp today. I did run into a stack overflow issue so I'll have to research how to recursively call functions so as not to do that.

I wrote a method that outputs something in a C like structure:

```


(defconstant START "{")
(defconstant END "}")
(defconstant TERM ";")

;; Struct that holds some data
(defmacro s-data (ident prop &rest props)
  `'(struct ,ident
     ,START
     ,(map 'list
       (lambda (property)
	 (list
	  (car property)
	  (car (cdr property))
	  TERM))
       (cons prop props))
     ,END ,TERM))
```

The issue is that it returns a few nested lists, whereas if I wanted to spit out generated C code I can't have that. Hence the need for tail-call optimizations to prevent overflows.

Either way, it was a fun little experiment getting to this point. Macros as well as functions seem to enable a lot of crazy things, so we'll see how that turns up as time goes on.
