Happy Thanksgiving! 

I'll keep it short today. I redid my project structure to be the following:

* `include/` - My header files
* `include_ext/` - 3rd party header files
* `src/` -  My source files
* `src_extern` - 3rd party source files

Why do this? Well, I really wanted to ensure that I kept my libraries separate from included libraries. I may want to wrap external libraries, or update them. Separating the source code makes it far easier to do so. 

Another thing I did today was add in [S7 Scheme](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/snd/snd/s7.html). I haven't decided whether to use Scheme or Duktape (JavaScript) for my scripting language, but I wanted to have both for the moment. 

The next stage will be implementing SDL2 OR Sokol. I haven't decided which one I want to use yet, but both seem like a good start. Another third option would be to interface with Windows and OpenGL directly. I'll likely end up with whichever is simplest. Sokol is my bet.

Here's my most up to date `Makefile` that supports my project structure:
