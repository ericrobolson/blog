I ordered the materials to make a Planck keyboard. This is a keyboard with something like 40-60 keys, one that has no number row and minimal other features. Why? To see what an 'ergonomic' keyboard is like. There's also some programmability in it that I'm interested in seeing. 

I'll be working on adding Sokol to my project. It may not be the most optimal library choice, but I don't care. I'd much rather get something building than

Well, I haven't gotten Sokol to work. I'll give SDL2 a shot.

Skipping SDL2 for now. I mainly worked on getting everything compiling across platforms. I've got Windows, WSL and my M1 Mac building + running tests. 

I'm moving off of Duktape and going with S7. I'll be using [utest.h](https://github.com/sheredom/utest.h) for unit testing. 

I'll dig into Sokol vs SDL2, but haven't made a decision on which to use yet. Ultimately it will be whichever is easiest to integrate into my project.
