I wired up a very basic renderer this morning. It is not optimized whatsoever, but that is not my concern. I want to get something drawing so I can start working on core gameplay, then pivot to a better solution after I have the engine built.

If you recall, yesterday was building out a way to update all entities. Today I leveraged that to render some bounding boxes. 

First I'll add a new entity to draw as well as a way to view all entities. You'll note I swapped the update order for the read world and write world. This was done in the event I want to do some form of multithreading.

```
// simulation.rs
use crate::{hardware_input::HardwareInputState, prelude::*};
use benchy::Benchy;

/// Simulation code.
pub struct Simulation {
    frame: Frame,
    read_world: World,
    write_world: World,
}
impl Simulation {
    /// Returns a list of active entities.
    pub fn entities(&self) -> &[Entity] {
        self.read_world.entities()
    }

    /// Creates a new simulation.
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        let mut write_world = World::new();

        if let Some(entity) = write_world.add_entity() {
            let position = entity.position.upsert();
            position.x = 320;
            position.y = 240;

            let aabb = entity.bounding_box.upsert();
            aabb.width = 8;
            aabb.height = 16;
        }

        Self {
            frame: Frame::default(),
            read_world: World::new(),
            write_world,
        }
    }

    /// Performs a single tick of the simulation code.
    pub fn tick(&mut self, hardware_input: HardwareInputState) {
        Benchy::time("simulation::Simulation::tick");
        self.frame = self.frame.increment(1);

        // Update the write world's state
        self.write_world
            .update(self.frame, hardware_input, &self.read_world);

        // Update the read world's state to match the current one
        self.read_world.copy(&self.write_world);
    }
}
```

I exposed this method on the `GameEngine` struct as well.

Finally I'll show off my main loop. I've yet to add in input handling, but that should be relatively simple to do.

```
use core_engine::prelude::*;
use ggez::event;
use ggez::graphics::{self, Color};
use ggez::{Context, GameResult};

fn main() -> GameResult {
    let cb = ggez::ContextBuilder::new("noiseless_mountain", "eolson");
    let (ctx, event_loop) = cb.build()?;
    let state = MainState::new()?;
    event::run(ctx, event_loop, state);
}

struct MainState {
    engine: GameEngine,
}

impl MainState {
    fn new() -> GameResult<MainState> {
        let use_replay = false;

        let (logger_file, replay_file) = if use_replay {
            (None, Some("logs.json".into()))
        } else {
            (Some("logs.json".into()), None)
        };

        let opts = GameOptions {
            benchmark_file: "benchmark.json".into(),
            hz: 60,
            replay_file,
            logger_file,
        };

        let engine = GameEngine::new(opts);

        Ok(Self { engine })
    }
}

impl event::EventHandler<ggez::GameError> for MainState {
    fn update(&mut self, _ctx: &mut Context) -> GameResult {
        match self.engine.tick() {
            TickResult::NoChange => {}
            TickResult::UpdatedState => {
                // ???
            }
        }

        Ok(())
    }

    fn draw(&mut self, ctx: &mut Context) -> GameResult {
        graphics::clear(ctx, [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 1.0].into());

        for entity in self.engine.entities() {
            if let Some(position) = entity.position.item() {
                // Draw bounding box
                if let Some(bounding_box) = entity.bounding_box.item() {
                    let square = graphics::Mesh::new_rectangle(
                        ctx,
                        graphics::DrawMode::stroke(1.0),
                        graphics::Rect {
                            x: 0.0,
                            y: 0.0,
                            w: bounding_box.width as f32,
                            h: bounding_box.height as f32,
                        },
                        Color::CYAN,
                    )?;

                    graphics::draw(
                        ctx,
                        &square,
                        ([position.x as f32, position.y as f32], Color::WHITE),
                    )?;
                }
            }
        }

        graphics::present(ctx)?;
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

Some of the next things I'd like to do are 
* Add in a render pass construct rather than iterating over entities
* Add in interpolation for the render pass
* Load worlds from JSON
* Controlled character
* Elixir matchmaking server
* S3 bucket for content

I suspect the next steps for me will be creating a platformer, then iterating on that.

Here's a screenshot of what it looks like so far:
