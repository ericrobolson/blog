I feel like I'm slowly making progress with Lisp. I wrote out a simple method + macro to convert Lisp code to something similar to C.

```
;; Creates a function that returns the given type
;; TODO: type checking
(defmacro defun-t (type id args &rest statements)
  `(defun ,id ,args ,@statements))

(defun-t t-int main ()
  (print "hello world!")
  0)


(defun get-c-type (type)
  (cond
    ((eq 't-int type) "int")
    (T (error "invalid c-type!" type))))

(defmacro compile-c (type id args &rest statements)
  `(list ,type id "(" ")" "{" "}"))
```

My intent by doing this is that I can write something using `defun-t`, leverage Slime to get interactivity, and then run a compile macro that converts it to a different language.

I don't know how viable that will be, but it seems like an interesting approach.
