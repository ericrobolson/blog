Not a fan of daylight savings. As someone who lives in the Pacific Northwest, it can be disorienting. I'm not sure there's any good solution, but I expect I will be slightly off the next few days.

This morning I took the time to split out a piece of functionality I use a lot into a separate library and posted it on Github.

All this library does is expose a timer at a set HZ, which then can be used for interpolation or triggering events.

Without further ado, I'll dive into it.

I know right off the bat I want to communicate whether something has been triggered or not. I typically lean towards enums to clearly communicate results of function calls.

```
/// Whether something was triggered or not
#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
pub enum Triggered {
    No,
    Yes,
}
```

Next up is something to keep track of how much time has passed. I'll create a wrapper for the `std::time::Duration` class so I don't need to be dependant on it.

```
pub(crate) type InnerDuration = std::time::Duration;

/// Struct representing a Duration.
#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, PartialOrd)]
pub struct Duration(InnerDuration);

impl Duration {
    pub(crate) fn from_inner(inner: InnerDuration) -> Self {
        Self(inner)
    }

    /// Creates the duration from seconds.
    pub fn from_secs(secs: u64) -> Self {
        Self(InnerDuration::from_secs(secs))
    }

    /// Returns the given duration in seconds.
    pub fn as_secs_f32(&self) -> f32 {
        self.0.as_secs_f32()
    }
}

impl std::ops::AddAssign for Duration {
    fn add_assign(&mut self, rhs: Self) {
        self.0 += rhs.0;
    }
}

impl std::ops::Div<u32> for Duration {
    type Output = Self;

    fn div(self, rhs: u32) -> Self::Output {
        let d = if rhs == 0 {
            InnerDuration::MAX
        } else {
            self.0 / rhs
        };

        Self(d)
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn add_assign() {
        let mut duration = Duration::from_secs(1);

        duration += Duration::from_secs(3);

        assert_eq!(InnerDuration::from_secs(4), duration.0);
    }

    #[test]
    fn div_by_zero_returns_max() {
        let duration = Duration::from_secs(1) / 0;

        assert_eq!(InnerDuration::MAX, duration.0);
    }

    #[test]
    fn div_returns_divided() {
        let duration = Duration::from_secs(1) / 2;

        assert_eq!(InnerDuration::from_secs(1) / 2, duration.0);
    }
}
```

The same will be done for keeping track of an instant, or a particular time.

```
use crate::Duration;

type InnerInstant = std::time::Instant;

#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, PartialOrd)]
pub struct Instant(InnerInstant);

impl Instant {
    pub fn now() -> Self {
        Self(InnerInstant::now())
    }
}

impl std::ops::Sub for Instant {
    type Output = Duration;

    fn sub(self, rhs: Self) -> Self::Output {
        let dur = self.0 - rhs.0;

        Duration::from_inner(dur)
    }
}
```

Lastly is the actual timer struct. I could have pared down the functionality quite a bit, but I'm simply exposing something I've used in other projects so I won't be too critical about it. Mainly going for ease of release, if that makes sense.

```
mod duration;
mod instant;
mod triggered;

pub use duration::Duration;
pub use instant::*;
pub use triggered::*;

/// Accumulative timer. Inspired by this: https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/
pub struct Timer {
    accumulated: Duration,
    last_tick: Instant,
    rate: Duration,
}

impl Timer {
    /// Returns the accumulated time for the timer.
    pub fn accumulated_time(&self) -> Duration {
        self.accumulated
    }

    /// Returns the elapsed time
    pub fn elapsed(&self) -> Duration {
        self.now() - self.last_tick()
    }

    /// Creates a new timer.
    pub fn new(hz: u32) -> Self {
        let mut s = Self {
            accumulated: Duration::from_secs(0),
            last_tick: Instant::now(),
            rate: Duration::from_secs(1),
        };

        s.set_hz(hz);
        s
    }

    /// Returns the current time.
    pub fn now(&self) -> Instant {
        Instant::now()
    }

    /// Returns the rate at which the timer runs at.
    pub fn rate(&self) -> Duration {
        self.rate
    }

    /// Sets the hertz to run the timer at.
    pub fn set_hz(&mut self, hz: u32) {
        self.rate = Duration::from_secs(1) / hz.max(1);
    }

    /// Ticks the timer. Returns if it was triggered or not.
    pub fn tick(&mut self) -> Triggered {
        self.increment_time();

        if self.accumulated_time() > self.rate() {
            self.add_accumulated_time(self.rate());
            Triggered::Yes
        } else {
            Triggered::No
        }
    }

    /// Sets the accumulated time for the timer.
    fn add_accumulated_time(&mut self, duration: Duration) {
        self.accumulated += duration;
    }

    /// Increments the time since the last execution, increasing the accumulated time.
    fn increment_time(&mut self) {
        let last_tick = self.last_tick();
        let current_time = self.now();

        self.set_last_tick(current_time);

        self.add_accumulated_time(current_time - last_tick);
    }

    /// Returns the last tick for the timer.
    fn last_tick(&self) -> Instant {
        self.last_tick
    }

    /// Sets the last tick for the timer.
    fn set_last_tick(&mut self, instant: Instant) {
        self.last_tick = instant;
    }
}
```
