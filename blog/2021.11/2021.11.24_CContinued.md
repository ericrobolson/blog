I'm not gonna lie, Makefiles are stupid. Coming from Cargo (Rust's package management) dealing with Makefiles is horrid.

## 0745

Finally hacked together something that should make life easier. Feel free to use it if you'd like. A project should be structured like so:

* Top Level
* * .obj/
* * include/
* * src/
* * Makefile

```
# Makefile

# Compiler related flags
CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-Werror -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic 
EXE = game

# Directories
INCLUDE = include
OBJ = .obj
SRC = src

# Misc sourcing of files
SOURCES := $(wildcard $(SRC)/*.c)
OBJECTS := $(patsubst $(SRC)%.c, $(OBJ)/%.o, $(SOURCES))

all: $(OBJECTS) $(EXE)

# Compile all obj files
$(OBJ)/%.o: $(SRC)/%.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -I$(INCLUDE) -c $< -o $@

# Link everything
$(EXE):
	$(CC) -o $(EXE) $(OBJECTS)

# Clean things
.PHONY: clean
clean: 
	rm $(OBJ)/*.o
```

Using this allows one to source + link all C and header files. I'm sure it will change over time, but it's good enough for now.

Ok, I'll take back what I said. Make is most certainly unintuitive. But once you grok it, it's quite nice. The main thing is the implicit dependencies and figuring out how to leverage them. 

I've updated my `Makefile` to include some tests, as well as some other nifty commands.

Commands:
* `make test` - Builds + executes tests using [test.h](https://github.com/yshui/test.h)
* `make clean` - Cleans all binaries and obj files
* `make` - Builds the program
* `make run` - Builds and runs the program

```

We'll see how long I stick with C, but I'm kinda digging the low level nature of it. 

Roadmap for C:
* Integrate Sokol
* Determine whether to use Duktape, S7, Embeddable Common Lisp or another scripting language
* Implement some GFX stuff
