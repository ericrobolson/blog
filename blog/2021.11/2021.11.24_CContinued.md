I'm not gonna lie, Makefiles are stupid. Coming from Cargo (Rust's package management) dealing with Makefiles is horrid.

Finally hacked together something that should make life easier. Feel free to use it if you'd like. A project should be structured like so:

* Top Level
* * .obj/
* * include/
* * src/
* * Makefile

```
# Makefile

# Compiler related flags
CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-Werror -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic 
EXE = game

# Directories
INCLUDE = include
OBJ = .obj
SRC = src

# Misc sourcing of files
SOURCES := $(wildcard $(SRC)/*.c)
OBJECTS := $(patsubst $(SRC)%.c, $(OBJ)/%.o, $(SOURCES))

all: $(OBJECTS) $(EXE)

# Compile all obj files
$(OBJ)/%.o: $(SRC)/%.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -I$(INCLUDE) -c $< -o $@

# Link everything
$(EXE):
	$(CC) -o $(EXE) $(OBJECTS)

# Clean things
.PHONY: clean
clean: 
	rm $(OBJ)/*.o
```

Using this allows one to source + link all C and header files. I'm sure it will change over time, but it's good enough for now.
