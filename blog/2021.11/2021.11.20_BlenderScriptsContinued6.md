Wrapped up the sprite sheet maker I've been working on. Took quite a bit of time, but I'll be throwing it up on Github and possibly YCombinator in the next few days. 

Since I work in the finance sector, we're preparing for Black Friday. I may or may not be posting much in the next few days due to that, but that remains to be seen.

In the mean time I'll be digging into some Elixir and working on error handling for a few APIs.
