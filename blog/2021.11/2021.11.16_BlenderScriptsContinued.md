Another big step was made today. I was able to embed my Python script into the Rust application, execute the rendering, and spit out the sprite sheets. I'll likely do a deep dive on the architecture when I have it all built out, but until then I'll keep plugging away until its ready to be released to the public.

Road map so far:
* Add in configuration for render sizes to CLI
* Add in multithreading
* Make sprite sheets more ergonomic for callers to use
* Add in examples for how it's all used.
