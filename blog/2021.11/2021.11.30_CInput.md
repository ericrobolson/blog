Dealt with a very strange issue over the last two days. I'm glad I'm doing cross platform development, as I caught a strange issue where reading a file in Windows added garbage to the end of the string whereas in Linux + Mac it worked flawlessly. 

Turns out when opening a file, there's a `b` mode for binary. This reads the raw bytes in, rather than parsing + converting new lines. Windows uses `\r\n` to denote a new line and when opening a file, will convert it to `\n`. This means that I was reading N characters PAST the actual file size, going into memory that wasn't allocated. 

Thus the weird scripting behavior I was seeing. 

Since I resolved that, the next step will be building out modules in Scheme. I won't have namespaces, but that is fine for my purposes. C doesn't, so this should be fine.

Another thing I want to start doing is working on some 3d modelling or claymation. I don't have any real reason, other than unique art styles.
