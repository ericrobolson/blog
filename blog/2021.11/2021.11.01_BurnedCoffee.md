A bit of a sad day today. I burned the handle off my moka pot, meaning I have no coffee. I immediately ordered a new one.

Oh well. I've began stubbing out how I may create an ECS that is generated from Lisp. Nothing too complex, mainly just writing out things that may prove useful.

```
(defconstant types
  (list
   (make-struct Vec3 (f32 x) (f32 y) (f32 z))))

(defconstant components
  (list
   (make-struct Hp (int hp))
   (make-struct Position (int x) (int y) (int z))
   (make-struct Transform (int x) (int y) (int z))
   ))


(defmacro make-struct (id &rest props)
  `'(struct ,id (properties ,props)))
```

I want to take this approach and see if it buys me anything.
