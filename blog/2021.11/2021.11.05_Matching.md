I've been working on adding in some matching to Lisp, so that an error is returned if something doesn't match an existing item.

First I'll write up a function that throws an error:
```
(defun match-error (value expected-values)
  (error "Error matching. Passed '~S' but expected one of '~A'" value expected-values))
```

From there I can then utilize it. I'll define a list of components, then generate some structs based off of it.

```
(defconstant components
  '(
    Position
    PreviousPosition
    HitPoints
    ))

(defconstant primitives
  '(
    int
    f32
    bool
    ))


(defun struct-definitions ()
  (mapcar (lambda (value)
	    (cond
	      ((eq 'HitPoints value) (make-struct HitPoints hp int))
	      ((eq 'Position value) (make-struct Position x int y int z int))
	      ((eq 'PreviousPosition value) (make-struct PreviousPosition x int y int z int))
	      (t (match-error value components))))
	  components))


(defmacro make-struct (ident &rest props)
  `'(struct ,ident ,@props))
```

Nothing too complex, but it allows me to ensure that when `struct-definitions` is called, I have all cases matched. Eventually I'd like to make a macro for `match`, but that's a future todo.
