I think I misunderstood Algol syntax. What I'm actually going for is a C style syntax as that will be most familiar to developers.

Now that I have some examples, I'm going to redo my intermediate representation (IR). These will be relatively simple and should get me going. I don't know whether to go with a compiler or interpreter yet, but I can defer that a bit.

The pros of an interpreter are I'll be able to iterate and dogfood the language faster, the pros of a compiler are faster execution. 

One possibility is that I'll write an interpreter, then dogfood a compiler off of that. For the unaware, dogfooding is using your own product to work out kinks in it. This is common with new programming languages as it is a example of a real world use of it.

I've restructured the code and started stubbing out the ADT IR. A lot of the stuff from previous posts was deleted so that I could start over in a more modular fashion. A module for `ir` will be created, and an `adt_definition` module will be put under it.

```
// ir/adt_definition.rs
use crate::prelude::*;

make_entity_type!(AdtIdentifier, &'a str);
make_entity_type!(DataIdentifier, &'a str);
make_entity_type!(DataConstructorIdentifier, &'a str);
make_entity_type!(GenericIdentifier, &'a str);

/// Top level definition of an Algebraic Data Type
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
pub struct AdtDefinition<'a> {
    pub id: AdtIdentifier<'a>,
    pub data_constructors: Vec<DataConstructor<'a>>,
    pub generic_types: Vec<GenericType<'a>>,
}

/// A value of an ADT
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
pub struct DataConstructor<'a> {
    pub id: DataIdentifier<'a>,
    pub values: Vec<DataConstructorValue<'a>>,
}

/// Individual value definition for ADT
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
pub struct DataConstructorValue<'a> {
    pub id: DataConstructorIdentifier<'a>,
    pub values: Vec<Type<'a>>,
}

/// A generic type
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
pub struct GenericType<'a> {
    pub id: GenericIdentifier<'a>,
}

/// Creates an Algebraic Data Type
pub fn define_adt<'a>(
    id: AdtIdentifier<'a>,
    data_constructors: Vec<DataConstructor<'a>>,
    generic_types: Vec<GenericType<'a>>,
) -> AdtDefinition<'a> {
    AdtDefinition {
        id,
        data_constructors,
        generic_types,
    }
}
```

The `ir` module will expose those structs and provide an enumeration for IR.

```
// ir/mod.rs

mod adt_definition;
pub use adt_definition::*;

/// Various forms of intermediate representations
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
pub enum Ir<'a> {
    AdtDefinition(AdtDefinition<'a>),
}
```

I'll stub out the `build_ir` method and write some tests I'll fill in later. This is mainly to provide a 'north star' to move towards.

```
use crate::{parser::*, prelude::*};

pub fn build_ir<'a>(parsed: Vec<ParseTree<'a>>) -> Result<Vec<Ir<'a>>, Error> {
    todo!()
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod adt_tests {
    use super::*;
    use crate::prelude::*;

    /*
    ;; Example ADT code

    adt Fruit {
        Apple

        FlourBased
        GrahamCracker
    }
    adt Pie {

        CherryPie
        MistakesWereMade
    }

    adt Option<Value> {
        Some(Value)
        None
    }
    */

    fn make_ir<'a>(code: &str) -> Result<Vec<Ir>, Error> {
        let tokens = tokenize(code, None)?;
        let parse_tree = parse(tokens)?;
        build_ir(parse_tree)
    }

    #[test]
    fn adt_fruit_example() {
        let code = "
        adt Fruit {
            Apple
            Banana
            Cherry
        }
        ";

        let expected = Ok(vec![]);
        let actual = make_ir(code);

        assert_eq!(expected, actual);
    }

    #[test]
    fn adt_crust_example() {
        let code = "
        adt Crust {
            FlourBased
            GrahamCracker
        }
        ";

        let expected = Ok(vec![]);
        let actual = make_ir(code);

        assert_eq!(expected, actual);
    }

    #[test]
    fn adt_pie_example() {
        let code = "
        adt Pie {
            ApplePie
            CherryPie

        }
        ";

        let expected = Ok(vec![]);
        let actual = make_ir(code);

        assert_eq!(expected, actual);
    }

    #[test]
    fn adt_option_example() {
        let code = "
        adt Option<Value> {
            Some(Value)
            None
        }
        ";

        let expected = Ok(vec![]);
        let actual = make_ir(code);

        assert_eq!(expected, actual);
    }

    #[test]
    fn adt_car_example() {
        let code = "
        adt Car {
            RandomGarbage(i32  i32  bool)
        }
        ";

        let expected = Ok(vec![]);
        let actual = make_ir(code);

        assert_eq!(expected, actual);
    }
}
```

There will likely be some additional tokenizing/parsing that has to be done to handle the syntax, but it's in a decent state. Another option I could do is entirely forgo the parsing here and directly write a Rust program that operates on these constructs. Not sold on that. 

The final, and perhaps easiest option, is to write an interpreter that operates in a stupid fashion and go from there. By stupid fashion I mean directly executing code as it reads it in. This would be the least performant, but the fastest to bootstrap. I'll noodle on that option.
