Yesterday I spent some time playing with Monogame. This is a cross platform, C# based game framework. It was simple to get up and running, but was missing some parts of Rust that I enjoy (ADTs). Truthfully though I may go all in on that as it is open source and extremely cross platform.

Another thing I've been doing is utilizing Emacs. The keybindings are very bizarre, but overall it's getting better. The main reason I'm doing this is I do not want to utilize VS Code unless absolutely necessary. Forced telemetry and dark patterns is the reason why.

To get up to speed on Emacs + Lisp, I've installed Slime. Slime is a development environment targeted towards Emacs and Common Lisp. I'll be utilizing that over time for various tasks, though I am not sure what yet. I do want to make a few types of games, but I really don't have any fantastic ideas yet.

Perhaps I'll get up to speed on Emacs + Lisp, then utilize Monogame to build the client and Elixir to build the server?
