Feeling like a different project for the moment. I'll go back to the game engine at some point, but have been wanting to do something else for a while now. 

There is one other domain that I am very interested in: Strongly + statically typed languages that cross compile. Imperative or functional doesn't matter to me, but I'm going to make a bet that functional languages are easier to maintain projects in as time goes on. 

I can come up with a laundry list of features I want, but at the end of the day I'd be happy with something that translates to Elixir and JavaScript. Perhaps C# as well so I could leverage Monogame or Unity for cross platform native development. 

Why not stick to JavaScript for everything? The answer is simple. I believe Elixir + Erlang have some insane potential for server applications and I don't believe in Electron will suffice for the quality of client applications I want to write. 

Perhaps a Swift + Java/Kotlin backend will be necessary as well for iOS and Android. Rust is also a strong consideration for native (PC).

Regardless, I will be doing a very simple interpreter to start. I'll take a functional approach to this project to make implementing the initial interpreters as simple as possible. There's unexplored space with Rust to see how ergonomic it can get. I will not be focused on extreme performance so I won't make this module `no_std` for now.

Gonna hack some things now then post back later.

I would like to approach this project in a manner so I can get immediate feedback and constantly iterate on it. An interpreter is an excellent way to do this. After that is working, I can bootstrap a compiler in the language that transpiles to many different languages. Haxe is an inspiration.

To begin with I'll add the main loop that fleshes out the REPL (read evaluate print loop). A REPL is a interface to interact with a running program.

```
// main.rs
pub mod cli;
pub mod context;
pub mod interpreter;
pub mod traits;
pub mod types;

pub mod prelude {
    pub use crate::types::*;
}

use crate::interpreter::Interpreter;
use crate::prelude::*;
use std::{
    env,
    io::{self},
};

fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
    // Read in args
    for _arg in cli::read_args(env::args().collect())? {
        todo!()
    }

    // Execute a REPL
    let mut interpreter = Interpreter::new();

    while interpreter.should_exit() == false {
        let mut code_buffer = String::new();
        match io::stdin().read_line(&mut code_buffer) {
            Ok(_size) => match interpreter.interpret(code_buffer) {
                Ok(action) => match action {
                    interpreter::Action::None => {}
                    interpreter::Action::Print(text) => println!("{}", text),
                },
                Err(e) => println!("Error: {:?}", e),
            },
            Err(e) => println!("Error: {:?}", e),
        }
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

I'll stub out the CLI (command line interface) next. Not much will go on in here until I decide to implement a compiler or loading of source files.

```
// cli.rs
use crate::prelude::*;

pub enum Args {}

pub fn read_args(_args: Vec<String>) -> Result<Vec<Args>, Error> {
    Ok(vec![])
}
```

I'll add a simple `Error` type so that when I need to return errors I can add to it.

```
// types.rs
#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
pub enum Error {}
```

Next up is the `Context`. Later on this will hold all data, definitions and other importation information as the program executed. For now it is empty.

```
// context.rs
pub struct Context {}
impl Context {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {}
    }
}
```

The guts is the `Interpreter`. This class manages the actual execution of code and modification of the `Context`. At this moment it simply echos the provided input unless an `exit` command is provided.

```
// interpreter.rs
use crate::prelude::Error;

pub enum Action {
    None,
    Print(String),
}

pub struct Interpreter {
    should_exit: bool,
}
impl Interpreter {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self { should_exit: false }
    }

    pub fn should_exit(&self) -> bool {
        self.should_exit
    }

    pub fn interpret(&mut self, code: String) -> Result<Action, Error> {
        if let Some(command) = Command::parse(&code) {
            match command {
                Command::Exit => {
                    self.should_exit = true;
                    return Ok(Action::Print("ðŸ‘‹".into()));
                }
            }
        }

        Ok(Action::Print(format!(">> {}", code.trim())))
    }
}

pub enum Command {
    Exit,
}
impl Command {
    pub fn parse(code: &String) -> Option<Self> {
        match code.as_str().trim() {
            "exit" => Some(Self::Exit),
            _ => None,
        }
    }

    pub fn text(self) -> &'static str {
        match self {
            Command::Exit => "exit",
        }
    }
}
```

Here's a demo of how it works:
