I'm starting to get the hang of Emacs. It's a process, but slowly getting there. Primarily using Slime + CL and hope to eventually add in Elixir and JS.

I really haven't gotten very far on any project, but for now I'm building up some functions to generate C code.

```
(defun make-struct (id first-prop &rest props)
  (concatenate 'string
	       "struct " (pretty-print id) "{"
	       (make-struct-prop (car first-prop) (car (cdr first-prop)))
	       ;; TODO: map rest of props
	       "}" ";" ))


(defun stringify-type (type)
  (cond
    ((eq 'char type) "char")
    (T (error 'invalid-type :unhandled-type type))
    ))

(defun make-struct-prop (type id)
  (concatenate 'string (pretty-print type) " " (pretty-print id) ";"))

(defun pretty-print (val)
  (format NIL "~a" val))
```

The idea is I can slowly build from the bottom up and make something that way. I chose C since it is a simple language that is very portable. I may do Rust or C# next, but want to get something simple first.
