I'm starting to get the hang of Emacs. It's a process, but slowly getting there. Primarily using Slime + CL and hope to eventually add in Elixir and JS.

I really haven't gotten very far on any project, but for now I'm building up some functions to generate C code.

```
(defun make-struct (id first-prop &rest props)
  (concatenate 'string
	       "struct " (pretty-print id) "{"
	       (make-struct-prop (car first-prop) (car (cdr first-prop)))
	       ;; TODO: map rest of props
	       "}" ";" ))


(defun stringify-type (type)
  (cond
    ((eq 'char type) "char")
    (T (error 'invalid-type :unhandled-type type))
    ))

(defun make-struct-prop (type id)
  (concatenate 'string (pretty-print type) " " (pretty-print id) ";"))

(defun pretty-print (val)
  (format NIL "~a" val))
```

The idea is I can slowly build from the bottom up and make something that way. I chose C since it is a simple language that is very portable. I may do Rust or C# next, but want to get something simple first.

I've been playing more with Common Lisp. One nifty thing I found you can do is write a function, pass it some input, and watch it explode. The benefit for doign this is simple: the runtime pauses execution. As it is paused, one can write functions + cases that fix the issue.  You can `C-c C-c and get it to recompile then resume execution.

My gut feeling is you can 'fill in the holes' as you write the program, fleshing things out as you run into new cases.
