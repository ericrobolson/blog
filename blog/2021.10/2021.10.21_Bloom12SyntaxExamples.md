## 0645

I may pivot how I build my parse trees. Lisp-like languages are extremely easy to parse, so I may take that route to see how far I can go.

I'll be honest, both of the syntaxes I've written so far are going to look foreign. I'm going to noodle on which I want to go for as well as which may increase adoption. Given that, I'll try out an Algol style as well. I'll simplify the Haskell style syntax and see which one is most readable. After that I'll get started on building the IR. 

## 0743

Ok, I've written up a final alternate syntax. While not entirely like C, it does take some inspiration from it. I'll throw up all the different ones and then think about which to go forward with and decide tomorrow.

## Algol style syntax

```
;; This is an example file for Bloom in Algol-ish syntax


adt Fruit {
    Apple,
    Banana,
    Cherry,
}

adt Crust {
    FlourBased,
    GrahamCracker,
}

adt Pie {
    ApplePie,
    CherryPie,
    MistakesWereMade,
}

adt Option<Value> {
    Some(Value),
    None
}

[Fruit] Display [String] {
    Apple = "apple",
    Banana = "banana",
    Cherry = "cherry",
}

[Option<Fruit>] OptionalDisplay [String] {
    Some(f) = Display f,
    None = "nothing!",
}

[Fruit Crust] MakePie [Pie] {
    Apple _ = ApplePie,
    Cherry GrahamCracker = CherryPie,
    Cherry FlourBased = CherryPie,
    _ _ = MistakesWereMade,
}

[Pie] GetFruit [Option<Fruit>] {
    ApplePie = Some(ApplePie),
    BananaPie = Some(Banana),
    CherryPie = Some(Cherry),
    MistakesWereMade = None,
}

[Option<Pie>] IsPie [bool] {
    Some(_pie) = true,
    None = false,
}

[Pie bool] DoSomethingRandom [String] {
    pie true = 
        Combine 
            "IsTrue" 
            OptionallyDisplay GetFruit pie,
    _ false = "this be false!",
}
```
