Productive morning so far. Wrote up the [Benchy crate](https://github.com/ericrobolson/benchy) for benchmarking code. This will allow me to make informed decisions when optimizing future projects.

I'll go through the code in a top down fashion, though I implemented it bottom up.

To start I'll flesh out the main entry points for the crate. This will be done through a `Benchy` wrapper struct that calls the necessary functionality when the `benchmark` feature is enabled. This means that code will only be called when a user (developer) opts in. 

```
// lib.rs

#[cfg(feature = "benchmark")]
#[macro_use]
extern crate lazy_static;

#[cfg(feature = "benchmark")]
mod benchmark;

/// Profiling interface for code. Typically used like the following:
///
/// 
/// use benchy::Benchy;
///
/// // Scope A
/// {
///     Benchy::time("test1");
///
///     // do some work
///
///     // Scope A exits, so timer was dropped and logs duration.
/// }
///
/// // Call save to save results to disk.
/// Benchy::save("someRandomFile.txt");
/// 
pub struct Benchy {}

impl Benchy {
    /// Creates a timer to benchmark a scoped block. When the scope exits, the timer is dropped.
    /// When the timer is dropped, the time it existed is logged.
    #[cfg(feature = "benchmark")]
    pub fn time(name: &'static str) -> benchmark::Timer {
        benchmark::timer(name)
    }

    /// Empty function for when the benchmark feature is not enabled.
    #[cfg(not(feature = "benchmark"))]
    pub fn time(_name: &'static str) {}

    /// Saves the benchmark results to the given file.
    #[allow(unused_variables)]
    pub fn save(file_path: &'static str) {
        #[cfg(feature = "benchmark")]
        {
            benchmark::save(file_path);
        }
    }
}

```

A key thing to point out is I'll use a static object for keeping track of all telemetry. This is done through the `lazy_static` crate which creates a single object that is used throughout the program. I wrote everything else before I wired that up, meaning that I could develop things in isolation. 

```
// benchmark/mod.rs
mod statistics;
mod telemetry;
pub mod timer;

use statistics::Stats;
use std::sync::Mutex;
pub(crate) use telemetry::Telemetry;
pub use timer::Timer;

lazy_static! {
    pub(crate) static ref STATISTICS: Mutex<Stats> = Mutex::new(Stats::new());
}

/// Creates a new timer.
pub(crate) fn timer(name: &'static str) -> Timer {
    Timer::start(name, STATISTICS.lock().unwrap().sender())
}

/// Saves the contents to the given file path.
pub(crate) fn save<'a>(file_path: &'a str) {
    use std::fs::File;
    use std::io::prelude::*;

    let mut file = match File::create(file_path) {
        Ok(f) => f,
        Err(e) => panic!("Error saving Benchy results: {:?}", e),
    };

    file.write_all(format!("{:#?}", STATISTICS.lock().unwrap().contents().borrow()).as_bytes())
        .unwrap();
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn dummy_test() {
        let thread1 = std::thread::spawn(|| {
            timer("test1");
            std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(400));
        });

        let thread2 = std::thread::spawn(|| {
            timer("test2");
            std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(200));
        });

        thread1.join().unwrap();
        thread2.join().unwrap();

        assert_ne!(
            STATISTICS.lock().unwrap().contents().borrow().clone(),
            std::collections::HashMap::new()
        );

        //
        // Uncomment below to save a file.
        //
        // save("test.text");

        //
        // Uncomment below to see how it works
        //
        // assert_eq!(
        //     STATISTICS.lock().unwrap().contents().borrow().clone(),
        //     std::collections::HashMap::new()
        // );
    }
}
```

This module provides functions that are called at the `lib.rs` level. When creating a timer to profile a section of code, it is passed a channel to communicate with the main benchmarking object. This allows multithreaded programs to utilize this crate.

Next up is the `Telemetry` object. It is a simple data structure containing a name and the duration it took to process that section of code. I've been breaking things into separate files to help keep the line counts of any particular chunk of code down.

```
// benchmark/timer.rs
#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
pub(crate) struct Telemetry {
    pub name: &'static str,
    pub duration: std::time::Duration,
}
```

`Stats` is the next structure I'll cover next. This receives the `Telemetry` messages, stores the duration, and provides access to all stored data.

```
// benchmark/statistics.rs
use std::{
    cell::RefCell,
    collections::HashMap,
    sync::mpsc::{self, Receiver, Sender},
};

use super::Telemetry;

/// The struct that contains all telemetry and statistics.
pub(crate) struct Stats {
    receiver: Receiver<Telemetry>,
    statistics: RefCell<HashMap<&'static str, Telemetry>>,
    sender: Sender<Telemetry>,
}

impl Stats {
    pub fn contents(&self) -> &RefCell<HashMap<&'static str, Telemetry>> {
        self.poll_contents();
        &self.statistics
    }

    pub fn new() -> Self {
        let (sender, receiver) = mpsc::channel();
        Self {
            receiver,
            sender,
            statistics: RefCell::new(HashMap::new()),
        }
    }

    pub fn sender(&self) -> Sender<Telemetry> {
        self.sender.clone()
    }

    fn poll_contents(&self) {
        let mut statistics = self.statistics.borrow_mut();

        for telemetry in self.receiver.try_iter() {
            match statistics.get_mut(telemetry.name) {
                Some(existing_telemetry) => {
                    existing_telemetry.duration += telemetry.duration;
                }
                None => {
                    //
                    statistics.insert(telemetry.name, telemetry);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Last but not least is the `Timer` struct. Whenever the `Benchy::time(name)` method is called, a new `Timer` is created. When the section of code that is being timed ends, it will report the statistics to the `Stats` struct and can then be saved later on.

```
use super::Telemetry;
use std::sync::mpsc::Sender;
use std::time::Instant;

/// Timer used for benchmarking code.
/// When dropped it sends off the telemetry.
pub struct Timer {
    name: &'static str,
    start: Instant,
    telemetry_sender: Sender<Telemetry>,
}

impl Timer {
    pub(crate) fn start(name: &'static str, telemetry_sender: Sender<Telemetry>) -> Self {
        Self {
            name,
            start: Instant::now(),
            telemetry_sender,
        }
    }
}

impl Drop for Timer {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        let duration = Instant::now() - self.start;

        match self.telemetry_sender.send(Telemetry {
            name: self.name,
            duration,
        }) {
            Ok(_) => {}
            Err(e) => {
                println!("Error dropping Benchy timer: {:?}", e)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

With that I can now progress on the engine.
