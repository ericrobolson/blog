I'm slowly getting better at using Emacs. I do bounce between it and VS Code, but am moving over.

My current project is building some Lisp code that generates this C program:

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    // Prints some numbers
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        printf("%d", i);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This is not anything complex, but it's a fun little test to see how far I can go.

I'm going with a bottom up approach, building out small little functions that get composed into larger functions.

The main guts is the `program` method which right now takes in a list of includes.

```

;; Creates an include.
(defun include (module)
  (append-nl (concatenate 'string "#include " module)))


;; Builds out a C program
(defun program (includes)
  (flatten-strings
   (flatten
    (list
     ;; Build out includes
     (map 'list (lambda (module) (include module)) includes)
     ;; Build the main function
     "int main() { return 0;}"
     ;; FIN
     ))))

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;; Helper funcs ;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;


;; Adds a new line to the string
(defun append-nl (contents)
  (with-output-to-string (stream)
    (write-line contents stream)))

;; Flattens the given list
(defun flatten (l)
  (cond
    ((null l) '())
    ((atom (car l)) (cons (car l) (flatten (cdr l))))
    (T (append (flatten (car l)) (flatten (cdr l))))))


;; Combines a list of strings into a single list
(defun flatten-strings (args)
  (cond
    ((null args) "")
    ((stringp args) args)
    ((stringp (car args)) (concatenate 'string (car args) (flatten-strings (cdr args))))
    (T (concatenate 'string (car args) (flatten-strings (cdr args))))))
```

I was wanting to play with some assembler, but I think C is a fine goal for now.
