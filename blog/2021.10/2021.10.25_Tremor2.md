Decided to take a break from working on Bloom. Turns out that making a language is no easy task. I really am interested in the idea of Bloom, but don't want to deal with the complexities of building a language right now. 

I want to make a game, but I don't want to deal with boilerplate code (drawing images, audio, windowing, etc.). Therefore I'm going to give [GGEZ](https://github.com/ggez/ggez) a shot. It has a Monogame feel, but is entirely in Rust.

I'll start by reusing some of my code from previous engines and wire up Benchy in the main loop. The general architecture will be a `no_std` library that makes up the core of my engine, with a GGEZ wrapper to handle the platform specific necessities.

```
// main.rs

mod impls;

use benchy::Benchy;
use chrono::{Datelike, Timelike, Utc};
use engine_core::prelude::*;
use ggez::event::{self, EventHandler};
use ggez::graphics::{self, Color};
use ggez::{Context, ContextBuilder, GameResult};
use impls::*;

const GAME_HZ: u32 = 60;

fn main() {
    let game_title = "Tremor2";
    let author = "Eric Olson";

    let (mut ctx, event_loop) = ContextBuilder::new(game_title, author)
        .build()
        .expect("Could not create game context!");

    let game = Application::new(&mut ctx);
    event::run(ctx, event_loop, game);
}

struct Application {
    benchmark_file: String,
    engine: GameEngine<std::time::Duration, std::time::Instant, Timer>,
    benchmark_save_timer: Timer,
}

impl Application {
    pub fn new(_ctx: &mut Context) -> Self {
        let benchmark_save_timer = Timer::new(1);
        let engine = GameEngine::new(GAME_HZ);

        let now = Utc::now();

        let benchmark_file = format!(
            "_benchmarks/{year}_{month}_{day}_{secs}.json",
            year = now.year(),
            month = now.month(),
            day = now.day(),
            secs = now.num_seconds_from_midnight()
        );

        Self {
            benchmark_file,
            benchmark_save_timer,
            engine,
        }
    }
}

impl EventHandler<ggez::GameError> for Application {
    fn update(&mut self, _ctx: &mut Context) -> GameResult<()> {
        // Save benchmark
        match self.benchmark_save_timer.tick() {
            Triggered::No => {
                // Don't save benchmark results
            }
            Triggered::Yes => {
                Benchy::save(&self.benchmark_file);
            }
        }

        // Tick simulation
        self.engine.tick();

        Ok(())
    }

    fn draw(&mut self, ctx: &mut Context) -> GameResult<()> {
        graphics::clear(ctx, Color::WHITE);
        // Draw code here...
        graphics::present(ctx)
    }
}
```

Right off the bat you can see I wired up Benchy. This was done so that I never have to think about it again.

Next off is the actual engine code. It is very bare bones right now but will be filled in over time.

```
// game_engine.rs
use crate::prelude::*;
use crate::simulation::Simulation;
use benchy::Benchy;
use core::{fmt::Debug, marker::PhantomData};

const MAX_SIM_EXECUTIONS_PER_TICK: u8 = 10;

pub struct GameEngine<Duration, Instant, Timer>
where
    Duration: core::cmp::PartialOrd
        + core::ops::Add<Duration, Output = Duration>
        + core::ops::Sub<Output = Duration>
        + Debug
        + Sized,
    Instant: Copy + core::ops::Sub<Output = Duration> + Debug + Sized,
    Timer: time::AccumulativeTimer<Duration, Instant>,
{
    sim_timer: Timer,
    simulation: Simulation,
    _duration: PhantomData<Duration>,
    _instant: PhantomData<Instant>,
}

impl<Duration, Instant, Timer> GameEngine<Duration, Instant, Timer>
where
    Duration: core::cmp::PartialOrd
        + core::ops::Add<Duration, Output = Duration>
        + core::ops::Sub<Output = Duration>
        + Debug
        + Sized,
    Instant: Copy + core::ops::Sub<Output = Duration> + Debug + Sized,
    Timer: time::AccumulativeTimer<Duration, Instant>,
{
    pub fn new(hz: u32) -> Self {
        Self {
            sim_timer: Timer::new(hz),
            simulation: Simulation::new(),
            _duration: PhantomData,
            _instant: PhantomData,
        }
    }

    pub fn tick(&mut self) {
        Benchy::time("game_engine::GameEngine::tick");

        match self.run_simulation() {
            Triggered::No => {
                // Not updated
            }
            Triggered::Yes => {
                // Was updated
            }
        }
    }

    fn run_simulation(&mut self) -> Triggered {
        Benchy::time("game_engine::GameEngine::::run_simulation");

        // Run the application until there's no more remaining time left.
        // Inspired by https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/
        let mut triggered = Triggered::No;
        for _ in 0..MAX_SIM_EXECUTIONS_PER_TICK {
            match self.sim_timer.tick() {
                Triggered::No => {
                    break;
                }
                Triggered::Yes => {
                    self.simulation.tick();
                    triggered = Triggered::Yes;
                }
            }
        }

        triggered
    }
}
```


Finally a `AccumulativeTimer` class is written up so that I can ensure that the simulation executes at the set HZ.

```
// traits/time.rs
use crate::types::Triggered;
use core::fmt::Debug;

/// Accumulative timer. Inspired by this: https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/
pub trait AccumulativeTimer<Duration, Instant>
where
    Duration: core::cmp::PartialOrd
        + core::ops::Add<Duration, Output = Duration>
        + core::ops::Sub<Output = Duration>
        + Debug
        + Sized,
    Instant: Copy + core::ops::Sub<Output = Duration> + Debug + Sized,
{
    /// Returns the accumulated time for the timer.
    fn accumulated_time(&self) -> Duration;

    /// Sets the accumulated time for the timer.
    fn add_accumulated_time(&mut self, duration: Duration);

    /// Increments the time since the last execution, increasing the accumulated time.
    fn increment_time(&mut self) {
        let last_tick = self.last_tick();
        let current_time = self.now();

        self.set_last_tick(current_time);

        self.add_accumulated_time(current_time - last_tick);
    }

    /// Returns the elapsed time
    fn elapsed(&self) -> Duration {
        self.now() - self.last_tick()
    }

    /// Returns the last tick for the timer.
    fn last_tick(&self) -> Instant;

    /// Creates a new timer.
    fn new(hz: u32) -> Self;

    /// Returns the current time.
    fn now(&self) -> Instant;

    /// Returns the rate at which the timer runs at.
    fn rate(&self) -> Duration;

    /// Sets the hertz to run the timer at.
    fn set_hz(&mut self, hz: u32);

    /// Sets the last tick for the timer.
    fn set_last_tick(&mut self, instant: Instant);

    /// Ticks the timer. Returns if it was triggered or not.
    fn tick(&mut self) -> Triggered {
        self.increment_time();

        if self.accumulated_time() > self.rate() {
            self.add_accumulated_time(self.rate());
            Triggered::Yes
        } else {
            Triggered::No
        }
    }
}
```
