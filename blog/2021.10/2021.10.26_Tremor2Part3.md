I've started working on some of the infrastructure surrounding this engine. I'm using Elixir for my backend with Phoenix as the framework. Nothing is wired up yet, but I'm working towards pinging the server from the client.

To that end, I've added `serde` as a dependency to my engine. 

I've also added a build script to copy a `res/` directory to the same directory as the executable.
 
```
use fs_extra::copy_items;
use fs_extra::dir::CopyOptions;
use std::env;

fn main() {
    println!("cargo:rerun-if-changed=res/*");

    let out_dir = env::var("OUT_DIR").unwrap();
    let mut copy_options = CopyOptions::new();
    copy_options.overwrite = true;
    let mut paths_to_copy = Vec::new();
    paths_to_copy.push("res/");
    copy_items(&paths_to_copy, out_dir, &copy_options).unwrap();
}
```

This way I can add a new configuration object and load it.

```
// config.rs
use crate::prelude::*;

#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
pub struct Config {
    pub server_addr: Option<ServerAddress>,
}
```

The `ServerAddress` object is stubbed out right now, but will be used for connecting to the Elixir server. I want to get the server connection going before progressing, as it will be a critical part of any game I make. It will also be easiest to handle now rather than later.
