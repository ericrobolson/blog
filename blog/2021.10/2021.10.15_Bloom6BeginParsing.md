Dealing with a bit of a leg injury + neck injury so I'll be skipping the gym today. There's a fine line between what can safely be used vs what would cause further injury. 

I don't have it down 100% perfectly yet, but I'm getting closer. Like all else in life I'm in it for the long haul, so if I need to take a break I will to ensure I can keep going.

Another fun thing is I've been toying around with SHIB (Shiba Inu Cryptocurrency). I don't think this is a good long term investment but that is not the purpose of the experiment. I want to see what trading it would be like. 

Yesterday I was up 5%, now I'm down 5%. My upper limit is +20%, though dealing with capital tax gains means I will likely want to reevaluate that. 

I fully expect to pay quite a bit in taxes, but since the amount is so small it's not a big deal to me. The main purpose is to gather experience with how trading crypto works. I'm happy to pay a premium for experience.

Not exactly sure what the best approach for a parser is going to be. What a parser does is takes a stream of tokens, then checks and converts it to something that is meaningful. 

There's a lot that can go into this and I have no clue what the best approach will be. For now I'll focus on getting some primitives (core building blocks of the language) added in.

I'll focus on whole numbers and floating numbers. In a later stage I'll validate the number's values, such as a `u8`, `i32`, `f32`, etc. but that will add complexity I do not want in this stage.

I'll start by adding a `Res<T>` type, a `Warning` type and a `Error` type. These will prove useful when I get to parsing lists or other things.

```
// types.rs

#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
pub enum Res<T> {
    Ok { item: T },
    Error { item: T, error: Error },
    Warn { item: T, warning: Warning },
}

/// A warning that may occur during processing.
#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
pub enum Warning {}

/// An error that occurred.
#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
pub enum Error {}

```

Before I dive into the guts of the parser, I'll add a new macro for creating types that are tied to entities. You'll see this used in the `parser.rs` file. I'll also extend the `make_str_type()` macro.

```
// macros.rs

macro_rules! make_entity_type {
    ($id:ident, $value:ty) => {
        #[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
        pub struct $id<'a> {
            pub entity: crate::prelude::Entity<'a>,
            pub value: $value,
        }
        impl<'a> $id<'a> {
            pub fn new(entity: crate::prelude::Entity<'a>, value: $value) -> Self {
                Self { entity, value }
            }
        }
        impl<'a> From<(crate::prelude::Entity<'a>, $value)> for $id<'a> {
            fn from((entity, value): (crate::prelude::Entity<'a>, $value)) -> Self {
                Self { entity, value }
            }
        }
        impl<'a> From<($value, crate::prelude::Entity<'a>)> for $id<'a> {
            fn from((value, entity): ($value, crate::prelude::Entity<'a>)) -> Self {
                Self { entity, value }
            }
        }
    };
}

macro_rules! make_str_type {
    ($id:ident) => {
        #[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
        pub struct $id<'a>(&'a str);
        impl<'a> $id<'a> {
            pub fn as_str(&self) -> &'a str {
                self.0
            }
        }
        impl<'a> From<&'a str> for $id<'a> {
            fn from(s: &'a str) -> Self {
                Self(s)
            }
        }
    };
}
```

Now I'll go into the guts of the parser. I'll break it into chunks and explain each bit in a top-down fashion, starting at the very top of the file.

First I'll create a bunch of types using the macros. These will represent booleans, comments, floats, whole numbers, identifiers and others as time goes on. I'll also make a very sparse `ParseTree` for the elements returned from this phase of the compiler.

```
// parser.rs

pub use crate::prelude::*;
use benchy::Benchy;

make_str_type!(Id);

type InnerFloat = f64;
type InnerWholeNumber = i128;

make_entity_type!(Bool, bool);
make_entity_type!(Comment, &'a str);
make_entity_type!(Float, InnerFloat);
make_entity_type!(Identifier, Id<'a>);
make_entity_type!(WholeNumber, InnerWholeNumber);

#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
pub enum ParseTree<'a> {
    Float(Float<'a>),
    WholeNumber(WholeNumber<'a>),
    // TODO: other types.
}
```

Next will be the `parse()` method that transforms things. The skeleton of this is very basic and unstructured right now, but as I implement more and more use cases I'll clean it up and break the bits into separate functions. This will end up looking like the `tokenizer`. 

The basic flow is iterate over all entities from the `tokenizer`, attempting to convert them to a parse tree item. If successful, return the element. If not I'll need to figure out how to handle it.

```
// parser.rs


pub fn parse<'a>(mut entities: Vec<Entity<'a>>) -> Vec<Res<ParseTree<'a>>> {
    Benchy::time("core_lang::parser::parse()");

    let mut entity;
    let mut float: Option<Res<ParseTree>>;
    let mut number: Option<Res<ParseTree>>;
    let mut results = vec![];

    // Drain all entities, converting them to a parse tree
    while entities.is_empty() == false {
        entity = entities.remove(0);

        // Attempt to parse number
        number = match entity.token.as_str().parse::<InnerWholeNumber>() {
            Ok(n) => Some(ok(make_number(n, entity))),
            Err(_) => None,
        };

        if let Some(number) = number {
            results.push(number);
            continue;
        }

        // Attempt to parse float
        float = match entity.token.as_str().parse::<InnerFloat>() {
            Ok(n) => Some(ok(make_float(n, entity))),
            Err(_) => None,
        };

        if let Some(float) = float {
            results.push(float);
            continue;
        }

        todo!("Continue implementing other types.");
    }

    results
}
```

As Rust can end up being very verbose, I'm taking an approach to create methods that return elements to cut down on typing.

```
// parser.rs


fn make_float<'a>(f: InnerFloat, entity: Entity<'a>) -> ParseTree<'a> {
    ParseTree::Float((f, entity).into())
}

fn make_number<'a>(n: InnerWholeNumber, entity: Entity<'a>) -> ParseTree<'a> {
    ParseTree::WholeNumber((n, entity).into())
}

fn ok<'a>(item: ParseTree<'a>) -> Res<ParseTree<'a>> {
    Res::Ok { item }
}
```

Finally we'll get to the tests. I've broken them up a bit into separate modules to test things like parsing floats, whole numbers, comments, etc. I'll also end up with another module for testing complex scenarios.

```
// parser.rs


#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    fn compile<'a>(code: &'a str) -> Vec<Entity<'a>> {
        tokenize(code, None)
    }

    mod floats {
        use super::*;

        #[test]
        fn parse_float_zero_number() {
            let code = compile("0.0");
            let actual = parse(code.clone());

            let expected = vec![ok(make_float(0.0, code[0].clone()).into())];
            assert_eq!(expected, actual);
        }

        #[test]
        fn parse_float_positive_number() {
            let code = compile("1234.123");
            let actual = parse(code.clone());

            let expected = vec![ok(make_float(1234.123, code[0].clone()).into())];
            assert_eq!(expected, actual);
        }

        #[test]
        fn parse_float_negative_number() {
            let code = compile("-77883.420");
            let actual = parse(code.clone());

            let expected = vec![ok(make_float(-77883.420, code[0].clone()).into())];
            assert_eq!(expected, actual);
        }
    }

    mod whole_numbers {
        use super::*;

        #[test]
        fn parse_whole_number_zero_number() {
            let code = compile("0");
            let actual = parse(code.clone());

            let expected = vec![ok(make_number(0, code[0].clone()).into())];
            assert_eq!(expected, actual);
        }

        #[test]
        fn parse_whole_number_positive_number() {
            let code = compile("1234");
            let actual = parse(code.clone());

            let expected = vec![ok(make_number(1234, code[0].clone()).into())];
            assert_eq!(expected, actual);
        }

        #[test]
        fn parse_whole_number_negative_number() {
            let code = compile("-77883");
            let actual = parse(code.clone());

            let expected = vec![ok(make_number(-77883, code[0].clone()).into())];
            assert_eq!(expected, actual);
        }
    }

    #[test]
    fn unmatched_parenthesis_should_return_error() {
        // TODO:
    }
}
```

I think next session I'll add in comment parsing as it's a relatively easy task.
