Played around more with Slime + Emacs. While I still don't have it down, it's a very different experience from what I've used in the past. The main difference is that everything happens so fast. 

What do I mean by that? Well, I can write a function, instantly compile it, and then test it out in a few seconds. There may be downsides to this process and the language, such as long term maintainability, but for now it's a different way to develop and I want to see how far it goes. 

At the moment I am just familiarizing myself with the workflow and testing things out. I'll slowly build up a library of methods to use, then perhaps generate some forms of code with Lisp that is then wired up into a game engine. Of course, that is the ideal and the real world destroys ideals. 

Regardless, this is a form of hacking I will pursue for a while longer.
