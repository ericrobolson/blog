Again, I do not want to work on the Index page for `blog_gen`. I'll be playing around with Chicken some more.

One thing that I'm going to want to do a lot is load a scheme file and treat it as a list.

Here's some code that does that:
```
;; Loads the given .scm file as a list
(define (file->list file)
    (let ((p (open-input-file (string-append file ".scm"))))
    (let f ((x (read p)))
        (if (eof-object? x)
            (begin
                (close-input-port p) '())
            (cons x (f (read p)))))))
```

This will be valuable as I can then write functions which load source code, transform them, then spit out something else. For example a parser or validator of syntax.
