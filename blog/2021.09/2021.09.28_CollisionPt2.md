## 0635

I decided to tackle the axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) collision check today.

This one gets a bit weird, as we can have AABBs that are a variable number of dimensions.

First I'll clean up the AABB Collider code a bit. 

```
// collider.rs

use crate::prelude::*;

pub enum Collider<N, Pos>
where
    N: Number,
    Pos: Vector<N>,
{
    Aabb { position: Pos, size: Pos },
    Sphere { position: Pos, radius: N },
}
```

Next I'll update the traits. Several new pieces of functionality will have to be added, such as querying the coordinates in a vector, getting the absolute value of a number and dividing by two.

```
// traits.rs
use core::ops::{Add, Div, Mul, Neg, Sub};

/// Generic number that the collision detection runs off of.
pub trait Number:
    Add<Output = Self>
    + Copy
    + core::cmp::PartialEq
    + core::cmp::PartialOrd
    + Clone
    + Div<Output = Self>
    + Mul<Output = Self>
    + Neg<Output = Self>
    + Sub<Self, Output = Self>
    + Sized
{
    /// Returns the absolute value of the given N.
    fn abs(value: Self) -> Self;

    /// Returns whether the number is zero or not.
    fn is_zero(&self) -> bool;

    /// The value of one.
    fn one() -> Self;

    /// The value of two. Used primarily for dividing by two.
    fn two() -> Self;

    /// The value of zero.
    fn zero() -> Self;
}

/// Generic vector that the collision detection runs off of.
pub trait Vector<N>:
    Add<Output = Self>
    + Copy
    + core::cmp::PartialEq
    + core::ops::Div<N, Output = Self>
    + Clone
    + Mul<Output = Self>
    + Neg<Output = Self>
    + Sub<Self, Output = Self>
    + Sized
where
    N: Number,
{
    /// Returns the value of the given coordinate. Example: vec3.coordinate(0) = x.
    fn coordinate(&self, i: usize) -> &N;

    /// Returns the length of the vector.
    fn len(&self) -> N;

    /// Returns the squared length of the vector.
    fn len_sqrd(&self) -> N;

    /// Returns the full number of coordinates. Example: Vec3::num_coordinates() = 3.
    fn num_coordinates() -> usize;

    /// Creates a vector with the given coordinate initialized to 1.
    fn from_coordinate(coordinate: usize) -> Self;
}
```

Finally the guts of the algorithm. This utilizes the Separating Axis Theorem. The SAT checks each axis for an overlap, and if all overlap, then there's a collision.

```
// collision/aabb_collision.rs
use crate::prelude::*;

pub fn execute<N, V>(
    a_position: &V,
    a_size: &V,
    b_position: &V,
    b_size: &V,
) -> Option<Manifold<N, V>>
where
    N: Number,
    V: Vector<N>,
{
    let n = *b_position - *a_position;

    let mut collision: Option<Manifold<N, V>> = None;

    // This utilizes the SAT (separating axis theorem) to calculate the manifold.
    // Iterate over each axis, check for an overlap, if so then continue checking
    // the rest of the coordinates. Only if all axi overlap is there a collision.
    for coordinate in 0..V::num_coordinates() {
        let a_half_extent = *a_size.coordinate(coordinate) / N::two();
        let b_half_extent = *b_size.coordinate(coordinate) / N::two();

        let n_extent = N::abs(*n.coordinate(coordinate));

        let penetration = a_half_extent + b_half_extent - n_extent;

        // No overlap so break out.
        if penetration < N::zero() {
            return None;
        }

        // Determine which direction the normal for this coordinate faces.
        // If it's less than 0 flip it.
        let normal = if *n.coordinate(coordinate) < N::zero() {
            -V::from_coordinate(coordinate)
        } else {
            V::from_coordinate(coordinate)
        };

        // Update the collision with the one that has the largest penetration
        collision = match &collision {
            Some(prev_coordinate) => {
                if prev_coordinate.penetration < penetration {
                    Some(Manifold {
                        normal,
                        penetration,
                    })
                } else {
                    collision
                }
            }
            None => Some(Manifold {
                normal,
                penetration,
            }),
        };
    }

    collision
}
```


## 0733

Looking back on my code, I may drop the circle vs X support and just go with AABBs. The reason being I don't want to muck with square roots right now and I don't know how to write a Circle vs X function that operates without them.

Done. I'll have to determine what to work on next. I think a math crate will be next on the list. From there I'm not sure where to go.
