Again, no Index page for `blog_gen`. Scheme is just too intriguing right now. I'll keep adding to my parsing methods. These can be used for converting a language to Scheme syntax.

```
;; parsing.scm

;; Parsing related methods

;; Loads the given .scm file as a list
(define (parse-file->list file)
    (let ((port (open-input-file file)))
    (port->list port)))

;; Parses the given string as a list
(define (parse-string->list string)
    (let ((p (open-input-string string)))
    (port->list p)))

;; Reads the given port as a list
(define (port->list port)
    (let f ((x (read port)))
        (if (eof-object? x)
            (begin
                (close-input-port port) '())
            (cons x (f (read port))))))

```

All the methods above are useful for reading files or strings and separating them into tokens.

Another thing I've done is write a macro that mimics Haskell syntax. Though this doesn't actually execute anything yet, it does spit out a list of elements.

```
// test2.cc

(define-syntax fn
    (syntax-rules ()
        ((fn id args return-type impl . impls)
            `(fn ,'id ,'args return-type ,(cons 'impl 'impls) ))
        ))

;; Test 1
(print 
    (fn fact (Int) Int
        ((0) 1)
        ((n) (* n (- n 1))))
)
;; Test 2
(print 
    (fn add (Int Int) Int 
        ((a b) (+ a b)))
)
```

The output for running this is as follows:
```
; loading test2.cc ...
(fn fact (Int) Int (((0) 1) ((n) (* n (- n 1)))))
(fn add (Int Int) Int (((a b) (+ a b))))
#;119>
```

I don't quite know what I'll do with this information yet. I suppose for now I'm just learning what the language can do and how to utilize it.

## 0921

I wrote a simple test module for Scheme. One thing I definitely want to do is write up a destructure macro. For this test module, I want to keep it as simple as possible with as few dependencies as possible. There's a lot that I can do, such as crawling a list of all files within this module, executing them recursively. I can figure that out later.

```
; unit-test.scm

;; An individual test case.
(define (test test-case actual expected)
    (list 
        ;; success or fail
        (cond 
            ((eq? actual expected) 'success)
            (else 'fail))
        test-case
        actual 
        expected))

;; A test module.
(define (tests first . rest)
    (let ((cases (cons first rest)))
        (map (lambda (case)
            (let (
                (result (car case))
                (test-case (car (cdr case)))
                (actual (car (cdr (cdr case))))
                (expected (car (cdr (cdr (cdr case)))))
                )
                (cond 
                    ((null? case) (error "you passed a null value!"))
                    ((eq? result 'fail) 
                        (print "fail - " test-case)
                        (print "\t wanted: " expected)
                        (print "\t actual: " actual)
                        )
                    (else (print "success - " test-case)))
                ))
            cases)))

;; Some example tests
(tests 
    (test "true should equal true" 
        #t #t)
    (test "true should equal true" 
        #f #t)
    (test "(+ 1 2) should equal 3" 
        (+ 1 2) 3)
)
```

I will give one win to Scheme, this was extremely trivial to write. It took perhaps 15m after I decided to do it to getting a working implementation done.

Using the REPL helps quite a bit, but I also wanted to ensure I can test things over and over, rather than doing everything manually. My hope is to start using this new project to generate code in other languages, so I want to make sure I keep this maintainable with some form of automated testing.

There are quite a few different ways I can utilize this module. I can import it and call it within specific files, or I can recursively browse everything and execute anything that matches `*.tests.scm`. 

I'll be tackling the `*.test.scm` method and seeing how far I can get with that.

## 1033

I decided to dogfood this module. I may end up utilizing some mocks as time goes on, but for now I'll just add a `map-path` method that combines a directory, parent and filename.

```
;; unit-test.scm

;; Appends the file parent and directory to the file
(define (map-path file dir? parent?)
    (string-append 
        (if (null? parent?) "" (string-append parent? "/"))
        (if (null? dir?) "" (string-append dir? "/"))
        file))

(testing map-path
    (test "map-path no parent? or dir? returns file"
        (map-path "foo.bar" '() '())
        "foo.bar")
    (test "map-path no dir? returns file"
        (map-path "foo.bar" '() "hi")
        "hi/foo.bar")
    (test "map-path no parent? returns file"
        (map-path "foo.bar" "dir" '())
        "dir/foo.bar")
    (test "map-path returns file"
        (map-path "foo.bar" "dir" "parent")
        "parent/dir/foo.bar")
    )
```


I'll also add a method to check if it's the proper file type to load.

```

;; Checks if the given file is a test file
(define (is-test-file? file)
    (cond
        ((string? file) (ends-with? file ".test.scm" ))
        (else #f)
    ))

;; Checks if the given string ends with the given suffix
(define (ends-with? string suffix)
    (cond
        ((and 
            (string? string) 
            (string? suffix) 
            (>= (string-length string) (string-length suffix))
            )
            (let (
                (end (substring string (- (string-length string) (string-length suffix)) (string-length string)))
                )
            (equal? suffix end))) 
        (else #f)
    ))

(testing ends-with? 
    (test "non-string input returns #f"
        (ends-with? 1 2) 
        #f)
    (test "'a test string' and 'foo' returns #f"
        (ends-with? "a test string" "foo")
        #f)
    (test "'foo string' and 'foo' returns #f"
        (ends-with? "foo string" "foo")
        #f)
    (test "'foo string' and 'string' returns #t"
        (ends-with? "foo string" "string")
        #t)
)

(testing is-test-file? 
    (test "nil returns false"
        (is-test-file? '()) 
        #f)
    (test "'regular-file.scm' returns false"
        (is-test-file? "regular-file.scm") 
        #f)
    (test "non-string returns false"
        (is-test-file? 1) 
        #f)
    (test "'passing-file.test.scm' returns true"
        (is-test-file? "passing-file.test.scm") 
        #t)
)
```

This is turning out rather nicely.
