Honestly this is baffling. Say you have three Scheme files. Each with macros. 

```
; one.scm
(define (one) "one")
```

```
; two.scm
(include "one")

(print (one))

(define-syntax one
    (syntax-rules ()
          ((one)
           "two"))) 

(print (one))
```

```
; three.scm
(include "two")

(one)


(define-syntax one
    (syntax-rules ()
          ((one)
           "three"))) 

(print (one))
```

What gets printed?

```
./three
one
two
three
```

At each stage of compilation, a macro rewrites the definition. I'm wondering how to utilize this.

Food for thought.
