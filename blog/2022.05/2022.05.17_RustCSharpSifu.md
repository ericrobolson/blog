This morning I was able to successfully link a Rust DLL to C# and call it.

Why is this cool? Well, I can now experiment with leveraging Rust code in a actual game engine.

You can check out the example code at [DemoCSharp/linkedRust](https://github.com/ericrobolson/DemoCSharp/tree/main/_linkedRust).

I've been slowly learning Unity, but at some point may pivot to using Rust libraries in Unity, Unreal or even Monogame. Stay tuned.

Sifu is a fantastic beat 'em up. It's brutally hard, but simple to drive. I highly recommend it and will be looking at using it to build some games.

Very tangential, but I may redo this website. Right now it's hosted on a droplet with Digital Ocean, but I may pivot to an S3 instance. I love the static site format so will keep that.
