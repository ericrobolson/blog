I've restarted development on Watcher in the Deep. 

For those that don't know, this is a program that is intended to keep an eye on files, then when there is an updated file, run some sort of program.

What could this be used for? In Rust, I could run this and run unit tests as I'm coding. I could develop an asset pipeline that when something is changed, it gets hot reloaded into my engine. Things like that.

It's rudimentary right now, but it will evolve over time. I'm hashing out the basic functionality as I use it, so it will drastically change over time.

[Here's a link to the repo](https://github.com/ericrobolson/watcher_in_the_deep).

Perhaps the way forward for me is to use Rust for CLI tools and other languages for other things. C# for game development, Elixir for APIs, JavaScript for web.
