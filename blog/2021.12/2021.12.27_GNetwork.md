I split off my networking code into a separate repo [linked here](https://github.com/ericrobolson/g_network). Why? I wanted to keep it separate from my other code in the event I go back to it. 

While I want to play around with other projects for the moment, I do want to revisit it at some point in the future.

For now I'll work on doing some simple development in Unity.
