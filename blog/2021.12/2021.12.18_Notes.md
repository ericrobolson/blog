Today I added in a note abstraction to my synthesizer. While the interface to play something is a little messy, everything works. 

I want to go through and clean things up before I continue on to the next feature however right now it's totally functional. 

Here's how Mary had a Little Lamb is played:

```
mod note;
mod synth;
mod tempo;
mod time_signature;
mod track_manager;

use note::*;
use synth::*;
use tempo::*;
use time_signature::*;
use track_manager::*;

fn main() {
    // Create the tempo
    let mut track_manager = TrackManager::new();
    let tempo = Tempo::new(128, TimeSignature { top: 4, bottom: 4 });

    // Play Mary had a Little Lamb
    for octave in 2..4 {
        if let Some(track) = track_manager.add_track() {
            let e_q = Note::new(tempo.quarter_note(), octave, Pitch::E);
            let e_h = Note::new(tempo.half_note(), octave, Pitch::E);

            let d_q = Note::new(tempo.quarter_note(), octave, Pitch::D);
            let d_h = Note::new(tempo.half_note(), octave, Pitch::D);

            let c_q = Note::new(tempo.quarter_note(), octave, Pitch::C);
            let c_w = Note::new(tempo.whole_note(), octave, Pitch::C);

            let g_q = Note::new(tempo.quarter_note(), octave, Pitch::G);
            let g_h = Note::new(tempo.half_note(), octave, Pitch::G);

            // m1
            Synth::square(0.5, e_q).play(track);
            Synth::square(0.5, d_q).play(track);
            Synth::square(0.5, c_q).play(track);
            Synth::square(0.5, d_q).play(track);
            // m2
            Synth::square(0.5, e_q).play(track);
            Synth::square(0.5, e_q).play(track);
            Synth::square(0.5, e_h).play(track);
            // m3
            Synth::square(0.5, d_q).play(track);
            Synth::square(0.5, d_q).play(track);
            Synth::square(0.5, d_h).play(track);
            // m4
            Synth::square(0.5, e_q).play(track);
            Synth::square(0.5, g_q).play(track);
            Synth::square(0.5, g_h).play(track);
            // m5
            Synth::square(0.5, e_q).play(track);
            Synth::square(0.5, d_q).play(track);
            Synth::square(0.5, c_q).play(track);
            Synth::square(0.5, d_q).play(track);
            // m6
            Synth::square(0.5, e_q).play(track);
            Synth::square(0.5, e_q).play(track);
            Synth::square(0.5, e_q).play(track);
            Synth::square(0.5, e_q).play(track);
            // m7
            Synth::square(0.5, d_q).play(track);
            Synth::square(0.5, d_q).play(track);
            Synth::square(0.5, e_q).play(track);
            Synth::square(0.5, d_q).play(track);
            // m8
            Synth::square(0.5, c_w).play(track);
        }
    }
}
```

One thing I may do is after I clean up everything and get it tested is release it as some sort of library.
