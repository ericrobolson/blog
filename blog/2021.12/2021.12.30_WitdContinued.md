I'll primarily be working on Watcher in the Deep, with some dabbling in other projects until it is 'done'. This morning I started by fleshing out a bunch of types and functionality to improve the error handling and parsing. 

I'm not exactly sure how it's gonna fall into place, but with some of the basic parsing and other logic I'm adding in I could easily transfer these skills to a scripting language or some form of compiler. That's a future project though.

I may do a deep dive after I've completed the project and cleaned up the code a bit.
