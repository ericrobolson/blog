I've been leaning hard into bottom up design combined with some form of TDD. I'm primarily using it for a parser right now that I'll throw up on Github. 

The general idea is I have a bunch of programs that could benefit from some form of interpreted languages, so by writing a parser I can begin integration.

The parser is moving along nicely. I've got a basic FSM to make tokens, but need to go through and call the methods for that. I want to add in some form of numeric tower.

I'll also need to decide whether to go all in on a Lisp syntax, or stick to a C based syntax. I can punt a little longer on that.
