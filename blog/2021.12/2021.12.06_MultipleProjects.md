I think I'm gonna focus on two projects. One that is some form of web app, another that is some form of game. 

Not sure on the web app, but for the game I want to start small and incrementally release projects.

Perhaps pong will be first? Then I can go from there. 

Not sure if I want to do 2d or 3d, but that can be deferred. 

For now I'll focus on the game, making a simple Pong across multiple platforms. It'll expand as time goes on.
