I'm using the Planck keyboard during non-work hours. It's still an adjustment, but I think it's gonna grow on me.

I'm at a cross roads now.

Do I do use SDL2, keeping everything in C, or do I make a library and call it from native methods? Both have pros and cons, plusses and minuses.

This was a good experience, and I'll throw things up on my Github. I think what I'm going to do is a combo of C and Rust, leveraging Rust for all my code and C to bring in useful libraries.
