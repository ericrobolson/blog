Today I spent some time installing and experimenting with Godot, Monogame and a Rust framework inspired Monogame.

The real thing I learned today was not which framework is best, but which one is easiest to set up. Installing a million dependencies to get something working is not idea, but it is good test. How easy is it to keep using it?

I want to do a bit more web development. Perhaps a new Miniclips type website, with some multiplayer? Everything done in Elixir, JS and Rust? It would be a good way to get people to test things out, perhaps a f2p model is the way forward.

I'll go over the scripts I wrote today to get Godot with Mono installed. I tend to take an approach where I delete something, then rebuild it over and over. 

Why? Well, doing everything constantly or multiple times means you get a lot of kinks worked out. It is more time consuming no doubt, but getting all the edge cases hashed out before usage is important. 


The folder structure is like this:
* _scripts/
* .installs/
* server/
* client/

`scripts/` has a bunch of shell scripts like this:
```
CUR_DIR=${PWD}

PROJECT=${CUR_DIR}/../GodotClient/

INSTALLS=../.installs/
GODOT_MONO=https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.4/mono/Godot_v3.4-stable_mono_osx.universal.zip

ZIP_NAME=Godot_v3.4-stable_mono_osx.universal.zip
ZIP_INSTALL=${INSTALLS}${ZIP_NAME}

EXECUTEABLE_FOLDER=${INSTALLS}Godot_mono.app/
EXECUTEABLE=Godot_mono.app

# Make install folder
[[ ! -d ${INSTALLS} ]] && mkdir ${INSTALLS}

# Download Godot Mono zip
[[ ! -f ${ZIP_INSTALL} ]] && curl ${GODOT_MONO} --output ${ZIP_INSTALL}

# Unzip
[[ ! -d ${EXECUTEABLE_FOLDER} ]] && cd ${INSTALLS} && tar -zxvf ${ZIP_NAME}

# Launch
GODOT=${INSTALLS}${EXECUTEABLE}
cd ${PROJECT}
open ${GODOT} --args --path ${PROJECT} -e
```

or this

```
CUR_DIR=${PWD}

PROJECT=${CUR_DIR}/../GodotClient/

INSTALLS=../.installs/
GODOT_MONO=https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.4/mono/Godot_v3.4-stable_mono_win64.zip

ZIP_NAME=Godot_v3.4-stable_mono_win64.zip
ZIP_INSTALL=${INSTALLS}${ZIP_NAME}

EXECUTEABLE_FOLDER=${INSTALLS}Godot_v3.4-stable_mono_win64/
EXECUTEABLE=Godot_v3.4-stable_mono_win64.exe


# Make install folder
[[ ! -d ${INSTALLS} ]] && mkdir ${INSTALLS}

# Download Godot Mono zip
[[ ! -f ${ZIP_INSTALL} ]] && curl ${GODOT_MONO} --output ${ZIP_INSTALL}

# Unzip
[[ ! -d ${EXECUTEABLE_FOLDER} ]] && cd ${INSTALLS} && tar -zxvf ${ZIP_NAME}

# Launch
GODOT=${EXECUTEABLE_FOLDER}${EXECUTEABLE}
cd ${PROJECT}
${GODOT} -e
```

I tend to constantly delete `.installs/` as that is where the installations go. I also ensure I get all dependencies figured out early on, trying to compile code in every dev environment I'm working in. A thing I'd like to do soonish is to wipe my Windows install, then also install Linux by it. Perhaps I could get away with just wiping a disk?
