I've started doing C# coding again. While it's not nearly as fun as Rust, I think I can use it to get the job done. I'll primarily take a C type approach to things, using structs and functions primarily. 

I've also been digging into the Unity asset store to get an idea for what things I'd like to use asset wise.

First things first: develop a game.
