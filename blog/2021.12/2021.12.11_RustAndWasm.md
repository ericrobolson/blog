I've been working on adding a WASM target for my engine. Still have quite a ways to go, but I figure if I can get that running it opens up a lot of possibilities. My idea is to create a web game, publish it, get data, tweak it, then possibly release native versions on various game fronts.

No idea if it'll take off, but it would be an easy way to test ideas out without requiring people to muck with executables.

Here's my build scripts for those interested:

```
# install.sh
echo "OS: ${OSTYPE}"

INSTALLS=.installs/

WIN_WASM_PACK_URL=https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/releases/download/v0.10.1/wasm-pack-init.exe
WIN_WASM_PACK_INSTALL=${INSTALLS}wasmpack.exe

# Make install folder
[[ -d ${INSTALLS} ]] && rm -R ${INSTALLS}
[[ ! -d ${INSTALLS} ]] && mkdir ${INSTALLS}

#
# Platform installs
#

# Linux
if [[ "${OSTYPE}" == "linux-gnu" ]]; then 
	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt install build-essential
# Windows
elif [[ "${OSTYPE}" == "cygwin" ]]; then
	curl ${WIN_WASM_PACK_URL} -L --output ${WIN_WASM_PACK_INSTALL}
	./${WIN_WASM_PACK_INSTALL}
fi

# 
# Generic installs
#

# Rust installs
rustup update
cargo install wasm-pack

# NPM 
npm install -g npm@latest
npm audit fix
```

```
# build_web.sh
#!/bin/bash
OUT_DIR=.web
WASM_PKG=pkg

# Init web dir
[[ ! -d .web ]] && mkdir ${OUT_DIR}	

# This script runs a native executable.
cd game
wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir ../${OUT_DIR}/${WASM_PKG}
RESULT=$?

exit ${RESULT}
```

And here's the updated build all script:
```

# Build web
TARGET=Web
echo "${TARGET}"
echo "${TARGET}"
echo "${TARGET}"
echo "${TARGET}"
echo "${TARGET}"
./build_web.sh;
RESULT=$?
[[ ! ${RESULT} == 0 ]] && echo "target ${TARGET} failed, exiting..." && exit ${RESULT}

# Build rest of things
cd game;
function build_target {
	TARGET=${1}
	echo "${TARGET}"
	echo "${TARGET}"
	echo "${TARGET}"
	echo "${TARGET}"
	echo "${TARGET}"

	rustup target add ${TARGET}
	cargo check --target ${TARGET}
	
	RESULT=$?
	[[ ! ${RESULT} == 0 ]] && echo "target ${TARGET} failed, exiting..." && exit ${RESULT}
};


build_target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
build_target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
build_target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
build_target x86_64-apple-darwin
build_target aarch64-apple-darwin
# TODO: androids
# TODO: iOS
```

I still need to figure out how to get the web assembly target up and running. It's building, but that isn't enough. Once I get it working as a webpage, I can then add the native client in for PC.

After that I can start hacking some form of renderer, then build out the rest of the app.

Not quite sure whether I'll do single player or multiplayer, but I can iterate on that later. Another thing I'll need to do is get some form of analytics running. That will be an Elixir server that handles HTTP requests.
