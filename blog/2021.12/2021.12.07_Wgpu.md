Yesterday I started on a GFX backend. Why? Because it's fun to me. Right now I'm targeting WGPU and WGSL, a GFX backend and a shader language. For those who don't know, these are ways to draw things on computers.

There are many backends and many shader languages, but I can't do them all at once. My current plan is to write up a simple one in WGPU, then target OpenGL, then perhaps Vulkan. All the while being cross platform. 

Lofty goal, but I find it cathartic.
