I've finally got Scheme files loading other scheme files. It's not pretty, but it suffices. This is a new `load` method, similar to what can be found in S7 Scheme. 

This is the C code:
```

/// Loads a module (another Scheme file).
static s7_pointer built_in_load(s7_scheme *s7, s7_pointer args)
{
	// Check first arg is string
	// If so then attempt to load module
	if (s7_is_string(s7_car(args)))
	{
		s7_pointer s7_str =
			s7_car(args);

		const char *str = s7_string(s7_str);

		struct GFile script = g_file_load(str);
		if (script.success)
		{
			load_script(s7, script.contents, script.size);
		}
		else
		{
			printf("error loading %s/n", str);
		}
		g_file_close(script);

		return s7_str;
	}
	else
	{
		return (s7_wrong_type_arg_error(s7, "module", 1, s7_car(args), "a string"));
	}
}
```

And this is how it is used:

```
;; Flags for running the game
(define gsys-quit #f)
(define gsys-repl #t)
(define gsys-hot-reload #t)

(load "./hi.scm")

;; Tells the engine to exist
(define (sys-exit)
	(set! gsys-quit #t))

(define (hi-there)
	(+ 1 2 3 4))
```

I'm finding that C gets the job done, but languages like Rust are far easier to use as a developer. At the end of the day though, I don't forsee myself spending a ton of time in C. 

Asset creation or scripting is where I'll likely spend time, but gotta get to that point first.
