As always, I keep bouncing back and forth on Lisp. At the current moment I'm using it to generate code in other languages. I'll be starting by generating some form of executable artifact, then will iterate on that somehow. No clue where it'll end up. 

I'm still working on other code in Rust, primarily my music synthesizer. Right now I've abstracted out note durations to be whole, half, quarter, eights, etc. and will be working on building some form of timeline next.

Making a timeline will enable me to actually compose songs, then generate some form of GUI to allow me to compose.
