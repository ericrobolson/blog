I'm digging the bottom up approach. It was relatively easy to add in some additional waveforms to my synthesizer due to this. I also added in the ability to modify notes. My main inspiration for features is my MS-20 synthesizer that I have. 

While hardware is great fun, I really want to see how to do it all in software. 

Another project I'm working on right now is a botting library. What this does is queues up keyboard input to execute, then runs it.

I want to eventually add functions as well as the ability to monitor memory and network packets, but haven't gotten that far yet.
