I began writing a simple synthesizer in Rust. I haven't gotten much farther than creating a sine or square wave, but it's a fun diversion from other projects. I'll keep working on it as I do want to get back into some music creation, though I don't know how far I'll go.

There's a few options:
* Create a DAW
* Create a synthesizer VST plugin
* Create a midi generator
* Create a standalone synthesizer

I began with creating a standalone synthesizer, but I may pivot and instead create some form of midi generator, then use other software or hardware to create the sounds. 

That seems to be easiest, so I'll go that route for now and revisit how things are done later on.

I'll need to figure out some form of GUI or scripting language. Leaning towards a GUI with all state that serializes to JSON.
