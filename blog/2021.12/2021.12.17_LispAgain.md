I've been playing with Lisp again this morning. The REPL is great for testing things out. I wouldn't mind getting to the same proficiency in CL as I have in Rust, but that can come with time. 

I added in some tempo abstractions for my synthesizer. It takes in beats per minute and can spit out quarter, half, eighth and whole notes. Frequencies will be the next step in this project.
