## 0731

I'm going to be doing some work on my Rust engine. While I'd love to get something that works on every platform, for now I'm going to focus on getting a simple framework so I can get applications built. 

Right now I don't feel motivated to use C# so that's out for gamedev. I also want to do some form of music project, and as audio requires real speed, Rust fits the bill.

I've continued work on the music program. It is a bottom up approach, where I get a simple thing working, then slowly build up parts and wire them together. This approach is one I should utilize more.

Sine and saw waves are now playable at specific frequencies, with specific durations and amplitudes. There is no abstraction at this point. 

Next will be some form of tempo (time) system, then a notes (time + frequency) system. I'll start with tempo, then move to the notes. Time seems a bit easier to deal with.
