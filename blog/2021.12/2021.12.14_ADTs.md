Working with C# I made a realization: I despise not having Algebraic Data Types. These are extremely useful in writing out logic. Not having them is a major pain. My immediate thought is to write a compiler to fix that... But that's not a good approach to get shit done. 

I'll suffer this one time, then evaluate it on the next project or until I can't deal with it any more. Perhaps I'll bring back Lisp.

Ok, after doing some writing, C# is really boring. I should have realized this, but I didn't. It will certainly get the job done, but there is so much boiler plate compared to JavaScript, Lisp, Elixir, Haskell, Rust, etc. I think C# is the right target language, but I'm not sure it's the right language to write the game in. 

I'll noodle on either Lisp, Rust, or Haskell for the DSL to use and then possibly generate C# code. That should hopefully make it a more enjoyable experience.
