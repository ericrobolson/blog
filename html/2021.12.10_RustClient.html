<div   ><p   >I spent some more time working on an engine inspired by Monogame. The hope is I can target desktop + web with this as well as mobile and others. Haven't gotten there yet, but I'm planning on just going for desktop right now. </p>
<p   >It's the platform I'm most familiar with and can get something working the fastest in. I think web will be next, then mobile, then possibly the Quest.</p>
<p   >Not sure if I want to do 2d or 3d yet, but I suspect 3d should be done first. If I go that route, it should be easy to do a 2d based on that. </p>
<p   >I've decided to add wasm as a compilation target now. I'm going to litter it with a bunch of <span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">todo!()</span>'s so that I don't need to implement it, but it should help deal with inconsistencies.</p></div></div>

<div   ><p   >Well, I went a different route. I'm getting everything cross compiling now. There's still a lot I need to figure out, but here's a script that will take a project, then check and build it on all the listed targets.</p>
<div   class="codeblockDark contentWrapperLight hoverShadowLight outlinedDark paddedbottomLight paddedtopLight shadowLight">
# This script goes through all targets I'd like to support and cross compiles them to ensure it all works.

cd game

function build_target {
	TARGET=${1}
	rustup target add ${TARGET}
	cargo check --target ${TARGET}
	
	RESULT=$?
	[[ ! ${RESULT} == 0 ]] &amp;&amp; echo "target ${TARGET} failed, exiting..." &amp;&amp; exit ${RESULT}
}

build_target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
build_target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
build_target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
build_target x86_64-apple-darwin
build_target wasm32-unknown-unknown
</div>
<p   >I still need to get the Apple and wasm targets building, but it's a starting point. </p>
<p   >Windows is the main issue, but I think I can cross compile with Mac and Linux pretty easily. That may be the route I take.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
