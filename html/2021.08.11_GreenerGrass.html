<div   ><p   >Well, the grass is always greener on the other side. There's really nothing more to say about that, other than it is a real struggle. Constantly bombarded by new languages, designs, ideas, frameworks, it's hard to stick to one thing. </p>
<p   >I'm starting to get the feeling that it isn't necessarily a crucial idea, it's execution. This includes the grind. Really, that's the hardest part right now. </p>
<p   >I have a roadmap for Chaostar, and though I have other ideas, I think I need to see it through. I don't want to spend ages on it as I want to do other things, but I do need to release something. </p>
<p   >Next up on the road map is going to be a Verlet integrator. <a  href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15462-s13/www/lec_slides/Jakobsen.pdf"  >See this paper for reference.</a> I am not sure whether to do 2d or 3d, as it will impact performance greatly. </p>
<p   >An idea is to use generics, with an <span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">impl Trait</span> for all parts. Then depending on the engine, I can execute it and go from there. I can flesh out the primitives using debug shapes, which will be expanded upon. After I can add in 3d mesh file loader and replace the primitives with actual meshes. </p>
<p   >Which format to utilize? Well, there's GLTF and OBJ. OBJ is faster to get running, but GLTF has more possibilities. Animations, PBR, etc. I will absolutely not utilize all features of the format, but perhaps as time goes on I will..</p>
<p   >Back to physics. The branch has been made and code will start. I will use a separate crate for this, and possibly do a mix of test driven development and type driven development.</p>
<p   >I am not sold on utilizing multiplayer quite yet. There's several avenues:</p>
<ol  type="1" class="listLight"><li><div   > Pivot to 2d single player Metroidvania like Rainworld </div></li><li><div   > Pivot to 3d FPS combat sim that's a cross between Escape from Tarkov and Chivalry/Mordhau. Possibly multiplayer, or a roguelike to start? Sequel contains MP?</div></li><li><div   > Pivot to a single player RE8 clone with Deadspace physics (dismemberment)</div></li></ol>
<p   >An option is to pick a non-multiplayer option, build it with the potential to add multiplayer, and then add it in a sequel or spin off.</p>
<p   >One thing I am doing is adding a <span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">hack.sh</span> script to each project. This typically will start WatcherInTheDeep with <span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">cargo test</span>. Having a feedback loop like this is extremely nice, as I just have to save a file and it runs everything. </p>
<p   >For the Verlet implementation, I am basically copying the code verbatim (to an extent, it's C and I'm using Rust), then renaming + refactoring it to meet my needs. Once the algorithm is implemented I can move on to changing it to fit my needs. I am not sure what to unit test here, for now I will implement it and wire it up to the simulation. </p>
<p   >I'm wondering if I should implement some sort of serialization layer so I can tweak config files rather than recompile. That may be an excellent goal to do after this part of the code is wrapped up.</p></div></div>

<div   ><p   >It's ironic how stupid mistakes can bring a simulation to a screeching halt. I'm referring to arithmetic overflow due to a mixup between a <span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">+</span> and a <span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">*</span> symbol. It compiles, so it works, right? </p>
<p   >For the blog generator, I would like to start adding gifs to them. How, I'm not entirely sure, but I think it would be a good thing to start doing when I get more visual elements going. Hell, it may be worth doing now. The idea is I'd embed a gif in the readme, then the website generator would link it in. </p>
<p   >Perhaps a project that tweets when I release one of these?</p></div></div>

<div   ><p   >One idea would be an image classifier. You load images into an app, and it goes through them. You can swipe images in 4 directions, 2 are categories, 1 is add a new category, and 1 is categorize later. From there it builds up albums of images you can then browse. Canidate for Lisp?</p></div></div></div></div></div>
