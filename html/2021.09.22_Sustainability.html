<div   ><p   >I've been experimenting to figure out the optimal way to exercise when injured. Pretty sure I strained a finger while climbing a week ago, so I've been adjusting my gym routine to accommodate that. Grip heavy exercises are skipped and sometimes I'll straight up not go if it's noticeable before I head out. </p>
<p   >My mindset is becoming 'how can I do this in a sustainable fashion for a long time?' I suppose I also take that approach for my career, for art, for anything. </p>
<p   >Posting this every day is something I want to do. I'm not sure it will always be about technical things, as I don't always want to do technical things.</p>
<p   >I want to experiment a bit with AI, with a final goal of generating music or art. There are several different paths, but like I talked about yesterday GANs (generative adversarial networks) are likely the path I'll take. </p>
<p   >These pit two AIs against each other, constantly evolving to come up with a way to detect whether an output is real or not. </p>
<p   >There are several frameworks to choose from, <a  href="https://www.tensorflow.org/"  >Tensorflow</a>, <a  href="https://keras.io/"  >Keras</a> or <a  href="https://pytorch.org/"  >PyTorch</a>. Each has pros and cons, each has different use cases. </p>
<p   >The primary factor I used for choosing them was ease of use and what was commonly used in research. I find the truly interesting algorithms are in white papers (aka research papers). Ease of use is key since I don't know what I'll be doing. </p>
<p   >I'll noodle on projects that I can do with these. I'm sure you'll see some posts about it here.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
