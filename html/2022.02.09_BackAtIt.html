<div   ><p   >Hello there, it's been a while. This past month I've been relaxing, taking some time off and visiting Florida and getting back into the swing of life. A break is extremely necessary and something I plan on doing more and more of. I was able to get some exploratory coding done, take some nice photos and check out some places I've never been to.</p>
<p   >For my current projects, I don't really have much going on right now. I'm muddling around with Haskell and will be learning Prolog shortly. There's one or two books on Scheme I need to dig into and a book on Elixir I need to wrap up. Not to mention C. </p>
<p   >Oh well, such is life. It's all about narrowing down what you want to do. Expect to see more posts now that I'm back.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
