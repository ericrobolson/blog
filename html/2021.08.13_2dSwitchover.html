<div   ><p   >I've started implementing a 2d Verlet integrator. This will be far more simplistic than the 3d one, as it will utilize int32 based vectors. I don't quite know how the math will shake out, and I strongly suspect the renderer will need to be switch up.</p>
<p   >That's fine though, as this should theoretically reduce the math required to implenment a working solution and reduce the issues I ran into with strange behaviour.</p>
<p   >The GDC on Rain World's animations system brought up a good point: If you can fake it, do so. I care more about the visuals and general effects of an IK + ragdoll system, I do not care about the 'trueness' to reality of it. I want something fun, something sexy, and something that is fast.</p></div></div>

<div   ><p   >Generics were a good idea, but complicate things. I'll be removing all generics I have regarding rendering + simulation numbers and not looking back. There will be separate types for physics + rendering, so I can use a determinisitc number (i32s) for physics and a non-deterministic one (f32s) for rendering. </p>
<p   >I can't really take the time to deal with all trait inconsistencies and implementations, so I will burn it down and move on. I can't take too much time for each feature as otherwise the game won't come together.</p>
<p   >It's not a easy process, but I think it will reduce the complexity of my engine and enable me to iterate quicker. There's now several core types with different purposes:</p>
<p   >Simulation:</p>
<p   >- IVec2 - A <span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">X,Y</span> i32 vector for 2d physics</p>
<p   >- IDegrees - A i16 based type that represents degrees used for physics rotations</p>
<p   >Rendering:</p>
<p   >- Mat4 - A 4x4 f32 matrix for transforms in the GFX world</p>
<p   >- Quaternion - A f32 type used for 3d rotations</p>
<p   >- Vec3 - A <span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">X,Y,Z</span> f32 type used for positions</p>
<p   >These should cover my needs for a 2d engine, and allow a 3d expansion over time. I'd have to figure out a 3d simulation that's deterministic but that is out of scope.</p></div></div>
