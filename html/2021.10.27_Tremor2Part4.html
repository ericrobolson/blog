<div   ><p   >Yesterday I spent some time playing with Monogame. This is a cross platform, C# based game framework. It was simple to get up and running, but was missing some parts of Rust that I enjoy (ADTs). Truthfully though I may go all in on that as it is open source and extremely cross platform.</p>
<p   >Another thing I've been doing is utilizing Emacs. The keybindings are very bizarre, but overall it's getting better. The main reason I'm doing this is I do not want to utilize VS Code unless absolutely necessary. Forced telemetry and dark patterns is the reason why.</p>
<p   >To get up to speed on Emacs + Lisp, I've installed Slime. Slime is a development environment targeted towards Emacs and Common Lisp. I'll be utilizing that over time for various tasks, though I am not sure what yet. I do want to make a few types of games, but I really don't have any fantastic ideas yet.</p>
<p   >Perhaps I'll get up to speed on Emacs + Lisp, then utilize Monogame to build the client and Elixir to build the server?</p></div></div></div></div></div>
