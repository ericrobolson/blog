<div   ><p   >I'll be starting on the mobile experience today. The only thing I know is I want it to be purely thumb driven, that is, no complex navigation. Screen space will be at a premium, so I'll utilize that heavily.</p>
<p   >Code blocks are a definite problem. Just about everything else works perfectly well.</p></div></div>

<div   ><p   >So far so good. Got mobile formatting done, footer spacing done, CSS for quotes + code blocks and more responsiveness tweaks done.</p>
<p   >One thing I would like to add is a 'paragraph' checker. That is, when it detects a chunk of text that is say greater than 144 characters long, it will emit a warning in the file. This way I can ensure that content is readable. </p>
<p   >After uploading the changed site, I still have some changes to take care of. The formatting on mobile isn't perfect yet, but that's ok. </p>
<p   >This is an iterative process that I'll get down eventually. While I would like to be done today, I suspect I won't be in a decent state until Monday. </p></div></div>

<div   ><p   >I didn't particularly want to do this but I don't think there's any way around it. The code is leaning towards the unmaintainable.</p>
<p   >There are two options:</p>
<ol  type="1" class="listLight"><li><div   > Refactor heavily and attempt to salvage things</div></li><li><div   > Archive this attempt and start over</div></li></ol>
<p   >I am leaning towards #2. Why? Simple: when you build something twice, it is far better. You can look at the first one and see areas that will cause headache later on.</p>
<p   >One thing I am not sure of is whether I want to keep this a separate domain. I am leaning towards yes. Marketing will be easier and I can always link to this.</p>
<p   >I won't have to worry as much about marketing everything under the same umbrella. Perhaps that is the greatest boon. </p>
<p   >If I do start over, and I think I will, I'll leave this content in place. The code that generates the pages is all that will change. </p>
<p   >As time goes on, I'm finding that the data is all that matters. If you always have the data, you can always regenerate things (such as a blog.) </p>
<p   >When I do start over, I will take better notes to show off the evolution of the project. I'll also take care to make it more data oriented and user friendly. </p>
<p   >Mobile will be the primary target when developing the website, and I may wire up a WitD shell to continually execute my changes.</p>
<p   >I'll spend tomorrow writing requirements, as I won't have the entirety of the day to dedicate to this. I can start the general file structure as well. If only there were more time in a day.</p>
