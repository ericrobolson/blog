<div   ><p   >I've been getting more and more into music production using my MS-20, Digitakt and various samples. It's been a blast.</p>
<p   >I'll also be getting more into gaming with a new PS5 and seeing what the current state of the art is for console gaming.</p>
<p   >Bouldering is going well as is lifting. I've switched to running 3x a week, climbing 2-3x a week and 2x a week for full body weightlifting. Sometimes I throw in some yoga to keep limber.</p>
<p   >Perhaps I'll build a Wordpress equivalent and serve it with Elixir? That may be a good project.</p>
<p   >I do want to experiment more in gamedev, but I am limited in the content I can pump out. I'll have to think hard on what I can accomplish and how best to achieve it. A vertical slice is a must.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
