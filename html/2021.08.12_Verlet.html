<div   ><p   >There's some form of bug with my integrator. It tends to align on the z-axis, which is definitely not wanted. I need to do some digging to determine what should be done here. </p>
<p   >Alternatively, I could switch to a pure 2d model and utilize that. In doing so, I could completely switch my coordinates to i32's, which are purely deterministic and would reduce the overhead of a fixed point number. </p>
<p   >It would unfortunately restrict the ability to do 3d, but that may not be a bad thing. At this point painting or pixel art seems to be faster for me to knock out, especially if I utilize a Dead Cells art flow. It also opens up the ability to target mobile</p></div></div>

<div   ><p   >I've made a decision. 2d pixel art will be the way forward. This means that I don't have to spend quite as much time on assets and don't need to spend quite as much time on complex art.</p>
<p   >Game choices:</p>
<ol  type="1" class="listLight"><li><div   > Pixel art (possibly using Dead Cells workflow)</div></li><li><div   > Fully deterministic 2d based physics using i32s</div></li><li><div   > Open world, fully simulated at all times like Rain World</div></li><li><div   > Ragdolls + procedural animations like Rain World</div></li><li><div   > Rollback netcode (enables coop or pvp)</div></li><li><div   > Escape from Tarkov like main loop, with physical based combat?</div></li><li><div   > STRETCH: Noita based cellular automata destruction</div></li></ol>
<p   >In a sentence, this game is a physics based combat sim where you execute raids to level up your character in between server wipes.</p>
<p   >I need to adjust my road map to accommodate this, and will do so later today. I still plan on utilizing a Verlet based integration system, however it will be tailored to 2d. I'm going to go for speed of development and not go for a 'perfectly coded' system. It will evolve over time, and that's OK. Don't need to get it perfect immediately. </p></div></div></div></div></div>
