<div   ><p   >This morning I worked on getting Godot + Mono working on my dev environments. It was relatively simple, I just needed to manually install Mono on my Mac. After doing so I got it up and running, so no issues there. </p>
<p   >Why do this? I still plan on keeping my Rust-y Monogame project going in the background, but I would like to ship some things. It's a bit easier to do that with an existing engine than to rewrite everything from scratch. </p>
<p   >Why C#? Simple: Unity uses it, Godot uses it, Monogame uses it, and I have 5 years experience using it. Obviously it will be different than what I previously did, but I like the idea of building my core application out in C#, making it engine agnostic, then wiring it up to whichever engine I want to utilize. </p>
<p   >Why Godot? I've used it in the past with some friends and enjoyed how simple it was to get things running. I won't be utilizing it to the fullest extent on this project, but I think I can get some nifty stuff going. I want to leverage the 3d capabilities, though I'm not quite sure how I'll do so. Something anime flavored would be ideal.</p>
<p   >I'll post up my Rusty Monogame project on Github. If you'd like to take a peek, <a  href="https://github.com/ericrobolson/RustyMon0game"  >here is the code</a>.</p>
<p   >With that done, I'll zero in on Godot + C# until I get bored or something comes of it.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
