<div   ><p   >I skipped working on any tech today. I plan on still making posts, but am starting to realize I don't have to just throw out code here. I went on a hike on Mount Hood with some friends today and saw some awesome scenery. It will help drive the paintings I do. </p>
<p   >My phone's camera is busted unfortunately, so I only had my memory to go off of. When I got back I immediately purchased a DSLR as I want to play more with composition, lighting and focus. That can only help my painting.</p>
<p   >I played some guitar for the first time in a long time as well. Rusty, but very enjoyable. It's something I need to keep up with.</p>
<p   >Lastly I watched some MMA. It is truly spectacular what those warriors can do and how they handle adversity. Perhaps humanity has some primal, violent nature and we live it through sports. </p></div></div></div></div></div>
