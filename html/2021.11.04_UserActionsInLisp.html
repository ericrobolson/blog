 0706</h3>
<div   ><p   >I'm getting much more familiar with Emacs. It's almost at the point where I have the keybindings memorized and going to VS Code feels awkward. Still going to keep using VS Code for blogging and work, but that will likely change in the future.</p>
<p   >Today I started working on building out some functionality to get a user's choice. The value in this is I can build out an application in Lisp, leverage the REPL environment, then build a compiler to generate a different program. </p>
<p   >Why do it this way? Lisp is extremely high level. Combined with macros, I should theoretically be able to write a very complex application very quickly. I get to scratch the compiler itch by transpiling it to a different language and I get to develop an interactive app.</p>
<p   >My first thought is to build a roguelike, but it really could be anything. Real time is not the goal yet but I could revisit that in the future. For now it will be turn based and utilize finite state machines (FSMs). FSMs are a fantastic way to encode choices and options that a user has.</p>
<p   >Without further ado, I'll show off what I wrote today. I still need to determine the best way to initialize state and deal with executing actions but I have a few ideas.</p>
<p   >I'll start by creating an <span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">enumerate</span> macro which takes in a list, adds a number and maps it. This will prove useful later on when I need to match a users choice to an action.</p>
<div   class="codeblockDark contentWrapperLight hoverShadowLight outlinedDark paddedbottomLight paddedtopLight shadowLight">
;; Enumerates a list, converting it to the form:
;; '("a" "b" "c") -> '((0 "a") (1 "b") (2 "c"))
(defun enumerate (l)
  (cond
    ((null l) '())
    (t (let ((idx -1))
	 (mapcar
	  (lambda (x) (setq idx (+ 1 idx)) (list idx x)) l)))))
</div>
<p   >Next I'll build out some methods to operate on my choice options. I'll have a <span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">choice-action</span> method to get a function that will be executed when a choice is made and a <span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">choice-text</span> to get the text to display to a user.</p>
<div   class="codeblockDark contentWrapperLight hoverShadowLight outlinedDark paddedbottomLight paddedtopLight shadowLight">
;; Gets the action for a choice
(defun choice-action (choice)
  (cond
    ((null choice) (error "null choice in choice-action!"))
    (t (car (cdr choice)))))

;; Gets the text for a choice
(defun choice-text (choice)
  (cond
    ((null choice) (error "null choice in choice-text!"))
    (t (car choice))))
</div>
<p   >Finally I'll write a macro to print out the list of choices, get the user's selection and execute the action. It's not complete yet but I'll fill it in as time goes on.</p>
<div   class="codeblockDark contentWrapperLight hoverShadowLight outlinedDark paddedbottomLight paddedtopLight shadowLight">
;; Gets a choice from the user.
(defmacro execute-choice (&amp;rest choices)
  `'(
     ,(print "-- Available options:")
     ;; TODO: nicely format the list of choices.
     ,(print (enumerate (mapcar 'choice-text choices)))
     ;; TODO: read in the user choice
     ;; TODO: if choice does not match choices, retry
     ;; TODO: else execute the method in the choices
     ,(print "NOW MAP THEM")))
</div>
<p   >I could easily see this being a function instead of a macro as I'm not doing anything too crazy yet. I'll keep thinking on what I actually want to build, but this will be the start.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
