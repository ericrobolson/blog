<div   ><p   >Dealt with a very strange issue over the last two days. I'm glad I'm doing cross platform development, as I caught a strange issue where reading a file in Windows added garbage to the end of the string whereas in Linux + Mac it worked flawlessly. </p>
<p   >Turns out when opening a file, there's a <span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">b</span> mode for binary. This reads the raw bytes in, rather than parsing + converting new lines. Windows uses <span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">\r\n</span> to denote a new line and when opening a file, will convert it to <span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">\n</span>. This means that I was reading N characters PAST the actual file size, going into memory that wasn't allocated. </p>
<p   >Thus the weird scripting behavior I was seeing. </p>
<p   >Since I resolved that, the next step will be building out modules in Scheme. I won't have namespaces, but that is fine for my purposes. C doesn't, so this should be fine.</p>
<p   >Another thing I want to start doing is working on some 3d modelling or claymation. I don't have any real reason, other than unique art styles. </p></div></div></div></div></div>
