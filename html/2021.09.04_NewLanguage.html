<div   ><p   >I am intrigued by Erlang + Elixir's processes. What would that look like in a more performant language that is native? The concurrency model + scheduling seems quite fantastic, perhaps that can be done as a language based off of Rust?</p>
<p   ><span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">#[catch_unwind]</span> and <span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">#[no_panic]</span> should be researched to see how this could be done. </p>
<p   >The intent would be to get a compiled artifact that is as performant as Rust natively is, but is as concurrent as Elixir is. I'll refer to Erlang + Elixir interchangeably, but will tend towards Elixir. Ideally this would be used on all platforms, web + native. Not quite sure how that'd work out yet, but it's a nice idea.</p>
<p   >While I love static types, perhaps a new concept would be a gradual typing. Something along the lines of a <span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">Any</span> type. There would also be the abilty to 'clamp down' the types as time goes on, as well as type-classes from Haskell to perform conversions. A reason for this is this <a  href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/105848"  >StackOverflow post</a>. One can quickly prototype in a dynamic sense, utilizing the 'let it crash' philosophy, and tighten the types as use cases come along.</p>
<p   >So the minimum features would be:</p>
<ul   class="listLight"><li><div   >Processes as a core part of the language, like Elixir</div></li><li><div   >Functional</div></li><li><div   >Let it crash philosophy, if a process dies it should not impact anything else</div></li><li><div   >Gradually typed</div></li><li><div   >ADTs</div></li><li><div   >Easy macros</div></li><li><div   >Extremely terse and simple </div></li><li><div   >Easy way to directly call Rust or JavaScript code from libs</div></li></ul>
<p   >This language should follow the below cycle:</p>
<ul   class="listLight"><li><div   >Dogfooded + bootstrapped compiler</div></li><li><div   >Minimal 
<span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">core</span>
 lib that can easily be ported anywhere</div></li><li><div   >A package manager, bootstrapped</div></li><li><div   >A small set of 
<span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">std</span>
 modules that provide file i/o, etc.</div></li><li><div   >Based off of Rust with 
<span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">async-std</span>
 or 
<span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">tokio</span>
 for non-blocking io for native</div></li><li><div   >Pure JS for web</div></li><li><div   ><a  href="https://medium.com/ballerina-techblog/implementing-a-language-server-how-hard-can-it-be-part-1-introduction-c915d2437076"  >Language server</a>
 </div></li></ul>
<p   >Looking at how the <span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">blog_gen</span> project has gone, I think a key part will be releasing fast and releasing early. </p></div></div></div></div></div>
