<div   ><p   >Lisp is taking some getting used to. Progress is slow, but it's good to be learning a new language again. I'm not quite sure when I'll get the markdown to html converter up and running, but that's fine. For now I'm building a backlog of posts.</p>
<p   >I do want to get back into game development with Rust. I think a bottom up approach with TDD would be an interesting experiment. There's several options I could take, but a hexagonal architecture will be key. While a generic engine would be dope, I'm unsure that is the proper approach. Simply building + releasing something would be ideal.</p>
<p   >Requirements:</p>
<ul   class="listLight"><li><div   >Deterministic simulation</div></li><li><div   >Lockstep or rollback netcode</div></li><li><div   >Synchronization of inputs</div></li><li><div   >Hexagonal architecture</div></li><li><div   >2d</div></li><li><div   >Real time</div></li><li><div   >Verlet physics</div></li></ul>
<p   >That's a good starting point. Real time is simpler for me to grok, and simpler for me to implement. </p></div></div>

<div   ><p   >I've started blocking out that project. Also added some tweaks to WITD so ignore directories could be specified so that it isn't reran whenever there are <span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">bin</span> or <span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">target</span> changes. I've added a simplistic MVP goal and a roadmap to see how it turns out. This may be too much to do for one person, but as usual I attempt to reach far. </p>
<p   >Code name <span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">Chaostar</span>, but that's likely to change. Hope is a Nidhogg/Bushido Blade like fighting game where it's ragdoll based. Not intended to be competitive, but is intended to be ridiculous. </p>
<p   >Focus will be 2d to really push what can be done on a GFX level and simulation level. While 3d is the trend these days, I will not be able to really push the physics as hard as I would like with rollback in a 3d plane. Perhaps a sequel would be 3d, but that's out of scope for now.</p>
<p   >I may pull code from <span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">noiseless_mountain</span>, but that project is retired for now. Perhaps it will be revisited in the future.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
