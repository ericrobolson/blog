<div   ><p   >I've wrapped up a basic version of <span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">Watcher in the Deep</span>. Couldn't think of any other name, so Lord of the Rings it is. It's relatively simple and bare bones, as it takes in a directory and a system command to execute. Not much more is required.</p>
<p   >There are several use cases for it:</p>
<ol  type="1" class="listLight"><li><div   > 
<span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">cargo test</span>
 - This effectively enables a REPL using TDD for Rust.</div></li><li><div   > 
<span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">sbcl --load "SOME STUFF"</span>
 - This enables me to use CL in a non REPL way. I think I prefer the TDD feedback loop rather than interacting with a REPL. This enables more consistent runs and ensures that I'm testing my code.</div></li><li><div   > Art assets. In the event that I make a game, I could see myself using a workflow like 
<a  href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/313026/Art_Design_Deep_Dive_Using_a_3D_pipeline_for_2D_animation_in_Dead_Cells.php"  >Dead Cells</a>
. Possibly combine with 
<a  href="https://github.com/ericrobolson/Heimdall"  >Heimdall</a>
 or some other hot reloading thing.</div></li></ol>
<p   >Turns out I like hot reloading/file watching. </p>
<p   >I think the next steps are creating some form of automation to execute a list of commands when the <span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">main</span> or <span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">master</span> branch is merged to. I like CICD and automation, as there's only so much I can do in a day. Some requirements I'd like to see are </p>
<ol  type="1" class="listLight"><li><div   > Convert my 
<span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">_blog</span>
 files into HTML and post that to 
<a  href="https://www.ggezbb.fun/"  >GGezBB</a>
. I prefer 
<span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">.md</span>
 files for writing and would rather not manage a static website. A simple Lisp generator perhaps + ability to upload to my server.</div></li><li><div   > Create + merge in MR's for my 
<span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">_opensource</span>
 projects. I like having things in one place to work on, but I would like to ensure that separate repos are created and maintained. Basically a trickle down effect. If others contribute I'll have to revisit how this works, but that is not a concern for now.</div></li><li><div   > CICD for web projects.</div></li></ol>
<p   >There's more I'm sure, but that's the bare minimum I'd like to see happen. Not sure which tech I'll use yet so stay tuned.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
