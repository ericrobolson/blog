<div   ><p   >I'm continuing where I left off yesterday adding in metadata, title, summary and keywords validation. I initially went with compiler errors, but am adding in warnings. </p>
<p   >I want to iterate on the design without having to be stopped, but I do want to know when I have issues that need to be addressed. No point in being excessively restrictive.</p>
<p   >The parser will go through the documents, parsing out metadata sections, keywords, </p>
<p   >My formatter for Rust is broken. I think if I do make a language, enforcing the formatting at the compiler level would be my preference. </p>
<p   >I don't want to have to deal with millions of extensions to get what I want, something that is batteries included would be ideal. </p>
<p   >Perhaps an image based language, with a terminal editor built in? Emacs crossed with Smalltalk is what I'm thinking, but without the complexity of OOP.</p></div></div>

<div   ><p   >I've added in the metadata parsing. The warning code I've added is a pattern I'll be utilizing more often going forward. Here's an example of what it looks like:</p>

<div   ><p   >I've uploaded a rough version of the website to see what it's like on different devices. Also had to learn how to deploy something with Apache. An automated deployment setup is something I will for sure write in the near future. </p>
<p   >Now that the website is live, I've been able to check it out on my tablet, Mac, and phone. The most noticeable issue is the width. Code blocks cause it to behave in strange ways and the side nav gets squashed. </p>
<p   >There is still quite a bit of work to do to get the UX in a good state; perhaps 80% of all the work is done. Some of the links are broken, though I am not sure why yet. I'll add it to the todo list before I notify others about the site being up.</p>
<p   >Lighthouse is a feature I'll want to use as well as other website checkers. Just figured out how to do mobile viewports and CPU throttling in Chrome. The ability to simulate lower end hardware will be key as time goes on.  </p>
<p   >It's sort of amusing how much there is to webdev at a lower level when you don't have frameworks and write it all yourself.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
