<div   ><p   >Working with C# I made a realization: I despise not having Algebraic Data Types. These are extremely useful in writing out logic. Not having them is a major pain. My immediate thought is to write a compiler to fix that... But that's not a good approach to get shit done. </p>
<p   >I'll suffer this one time, then evaluate it on the next project or until I can't deal with it any more. Perhaps I'll bring back Lisp.</p>
<p   >Ok, after doing some writing, C# is really boring. I should have realized this, but I didn't. It will certainly get the job done, but there is so much boiler plate compared to JavaScript, Lisp, Elixir, Haskell, Rust, etc. I think C# is the right target language, but I'm not sure it's the right language to write the game in. </p>
<p   >I'll noodle on either Lisp, Rust, or Haskell for the DSL to use and then possibly generate C# code. That should hopefully make it a more enjoyable experience.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
