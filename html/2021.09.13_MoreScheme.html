<div   ><p   >I played with some Scheme last night. Perhaps it's me, but I'm still not sure the language is all that. It's fun, but it's very different from what I've preferred in the past. I can see how macros are useful and have the 'glimmer' of insight every so often, but it's wack.</p>
<p   >That may just be me, as I have strictly preferred Rust, Haskell, TypeScript and C# previously. At work we use Elixir and JS, so there are some aspects of dynamically typed languages but not that much. I'll stick with it and see what comes around.</p>
<p   >I did try setting up an Elixir project yesterday, though I ran into some serious issues with the db and can't get unit tests to work. Not exactly sure why, but if I can't get an easy set up going I'll instantly hate the language. Perhaps Rust will be utilized for all things server-side, or Scheme that generates a Rust app.</p>
<p   >Perhaps some form of typed Scheme is a possibility?</p>
<p   >I continued on the index and about me page generation for <span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">blog_gen</span>. I'll post back here once that's wrapped up, but not much to show at the moment.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
