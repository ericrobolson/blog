<div   ><p   >Added a basic input mapper. Actions are wired up, then when input occurs it's checked to see if it's active. I don't particularly like the implementation right now, so I am going to convert it to an input poller that then gets queried by the system. While events may be preferable, I don't really care as polling is simpler to implement. </p></div></div>

<div   ><p   >Input polling has been added to Chaostar. While it's not the most elegant, it serves the purpose and will enable me to progress with other things. I could easily add ranges later on or perhaps triggers, but that's not necessary. I still want to work on IceCream, but that can wait a bit. </p>
<p   >I do like the idea of utilizing the React model for game UI's, and perhaps writing a compiler in Lisp that spits out code (JS, bytecode, Xamarin, Monogame, whatever) across multiple platforms to ensure I can easily write cross platform apps. Primary goal is to ship something in Rust, even if it is not the game I'd want. </p>
<p   > </p>
<p   >I'd also like to experiment with <a  href="https://lovr.org/"  >LOVR</a>. Terrible name that makes me thing it is a VR porn framework, but alas. Perhaps it can also be wired up using IceCream? I may never get to the quality of Resident Evil 8's renderer, but that may not be necessary. If I can generate products easily that do not require maintenance, or are easily portable, perhaps I can leverage that.</p>
<p   >For work and personal tasks, I've been using a 'roadmap'. This is a simple checkbox list of tasks that must be wrapped up. The nice part is for large projects, as things get knocked out the momentum builds up. </p>
<p   >Multiple players have been added as well as the start of systems in this engine. It's relatively simple, but I'm starting to like how it is coming together.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
