<div   ><p   >I think I may slow down on these posts. </p>
<p   >One thing I've found is it's easy to get caught in the grind, often at the expense of other things. Game dev for example. I've been climbing, reading and doing music production again. </p>
<p   >So what if I am not working on a game? There's more to life than hacking.</p>
<p   >With that said, I'm scoping out my next weightlifting routine. Spreadsheets work but I want to make a web app that automates most of it. </p>
<p   >Enter <span   class="codeblockDark outlinedDark">Fit.School</span>. The name's a WIP. </p>
<p   >The language is Elixir and has been extremely easy to get up and running in. I'm doing a functional core for all the logic, then will persist the data required into a database. </p>
<p   >The hope is that by leaving out the majority of side effects, I can develop a core library of logic and wire it up in a web server. So far it seems promising and I'm sure I'll do more posts on it.</p>
<p   >All I can say is REPLs and functional languages make things a breeze. </p></div></div></div></div></div>
